Chile swine flu cases jump to 276
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santiago, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chilean health authorities confirmed 26 new cases of swine flu on Sunday,
raising the number of patients with A(H1N1) virus in the country to 276, the
highest number on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The sometimes-deadly disease continued its rise across Latin America meanwhile
with Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Dominican Republic all reporting
new cases.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that most of the victims were in the capital, and that most
cases were mild and being treated at home. Three people remain in serious
condition in hospital, however.
</P>
<P>
Swine flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North
America in late April.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually
now killed more than 110 people around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold,
as winter sets in and the regular flu season gets underway.
</P>
<P>
Argentine health authorities meanwhile reported 15 new cases on Sunday, a day
after reporting 20 new cases, raising the country's total patient count to 115.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Buenos Aires said those with new swine flu infections were
recovering well and that most of them were found at several private schools in
the capital, where students had recently returned from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid
to contain the virus.
</P>
<P>
In the Dominican Republic officials confirmed nine cases of the disease, raising
the country's total to 11, a day after Santo Domingo rebuffed a Russian claim
that the Caribbean island was underreporting its cases in a bid to boost
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that in reality, the situation is very different," Gennady Onishchenko,
Russia's chief sanitary inspector, had told the Interfax news agency in response
to the island reporting only two cases.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the island's Ministry of Public Health reported that of the nine new
cases one had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
In Peru health authorities said they had confirmed two more cases of the virus,
bringing the country's total to 40.
</P>
<P>
Both cases were found in Lima and are recovering well on medication at home,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also confirmed four new cases, which brought the country's total number
to 20.
</P>
<P>
At its last count at the end of last week Mexican authorities said 97 people had
died from the disease and that 4,932 had been infected. Officials however
maintained that the epidemic was on the wane there.

Basketball: Despite sting of defeat, James says Cavs on right track
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player LeBron James insisted
Sunday that Cleveland were on the right track, despite their painful failure to
reach the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
James couldn't bring himself to address the media or congratulate the players of
the Orlando Magic on Saturday night, after the Magic defeated the Cavs in game
six of the Eastern Conference finals to reach the league's championship series.
</P>
<P>
But as he and teammates gathered for the last team meeting of the season here on
Sunday, James tried to put a positive spin on the Cavaliers season.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland notched the best record in the regular season with 66 victories, won
their division and swept to victory in four games in each of their first two
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
Then they ran into the surprising Magic, who had already ousted reigning
champions Boston in seven games, and even "King" James's heroics couldn't save
them.
</P>
<P>
"You want to continue to get better, that's all you can ask," said James, whose
team lost to Boston in the conference finals last year.
</P>
<P>
"We got better this season and I feel this team will be better next season. You
don't want to take a step backward. I thought we went forward from the Boston
series to this year and hopefully we can go forward one more time next year."
</P>
<P>
James certainly did all he could to take his team one step further.
</P>
<P>
His buzzer-beating 3-pointer saved Cleveland in game two against Orlando. He had
21 points, 17 in the second half, in game five, a contest that saw him finish
with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
Now the big question exercising Cleveland - the club's management, his teammates
and Cavs fans - is how this defeat will influence his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers can offer him a contract extension in July. He can extend the
contract up to four years, or play out his current contract that ends after next
season and make a move via free agency. He could also exercise a player option
for the 2010-11 season.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about it just yet," James said. "I'm just going to take time
off from basketball and not think about contracts or the game, period, and relax
with my family."
</P>
<P>
James defended his actions in Orlando on Saturday, when he strode off the court
- to a smattering of taunts from Magic fans - without congratulating his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have much to say," said James, who said he had since e-mailed
Orlando star Dwight Howard. "One thing about me you've got to understand - it is
hard for me to congratulate somebody after just losing to him.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a winner. That's not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody
beats you up, you are not going to congratulate them (for) beating you up. That
doesn't make sense to me."

Business says British politicians distracted by expenses row
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting
the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all
the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession
ahead of European and local elections later this week.
</P>
<P>
"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of
bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is
palpable," Lambert told the FT.
</P>
<P>
"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by
these disclosures."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but
we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the
future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to
one side."
</P>
<P>
Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour
party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament
on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and
analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip)
and the far-right British National Party to benefit.
</P>
<P>
Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls
for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing
with the economy every day."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP,
describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging
voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.

Golf: Stricker claims Colonial crown at second hole of sudden death
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT WORTH, Texas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Stricker birdied the second playoff hole to win the 6.2 million-dollar
Colonial on Sunday, leaving South African Tim Clark still in search of his first
USPGA tour title.
</P>
<P>
Stricker defeated Clark and Steve Marino in the playoff to claim his first title
of 2009 to go with his runner-up, third-place, fourth-place, sixth- and seventh-
place finishes this year.
</P>
<P>
For Clark it was yet another near miss. His 12.7 million dollars in US earnings
are the most of any player without a victory in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
He squandered a two-shot lead with five holes left, including a bogey on the
72nd hole that forced the playoff.
</P>
<P>
He also missed a putt that would have given him the victory at the first playoff
hole.
</P>
<P>
On the second, Stricker stuck his approach within a few feet and Clark almost
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
But Clark's hit the stick and rolled more than 20 feet away. The South African
missed his birdie attempt and Stricker made his for a fifth career crown.
</P>
<P>
Clark, meanwhile, settled for a seventh second-place finish, including at this
tournament behind Phil Mickelson last year.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who started the day with a two-stroke lead, carded a 70 to finish
regulation on 263. Stricker and Marino both shot 68 to join him in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jason Day carded a 69 to finish alone in fourth on 264, one shot in
front of England's Paul Casey.

2,000 to leave Australian flu ship after all-clear: officials
</HEADLINE>

Sydney, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,000 passengers were given the all-clear to leave the Pacific Dawn cruise
ship here on Monday after Australian officials found none was carrying swine
flu.
</P>
<P>
The ship has been at the centre of an outcry after infected passengers were
allowed to disembark last week, prompting an explosion in Australia's swine flu
cases.
</P>
<P>
"No evidence of any additional cases of human swine influenza has been found on
board the Pacific Dawn, and most importantly, there has been no person-to-person
transmission on board the ship," New South Wales' top health official, Kerry
Chant, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Three crew members who caught the disease have now recovered and remain in
quarantine, P&amp;O Cruises said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Infected passengers were among 2,000 who disembarked here last Monday following
an earlier cruise on the ship. Australia's swine flu cases, then fewer than 20,
had shot up to 303 by Sunday.

Britain's Prince Harry admits finding army training tough
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's Prince Harry admitted Monday that he sometimes questions whether he
will succeed in his army training -- but said his brother Prince William helps
take the pressure off by cooking for him.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late princess Diana,
is currently training to be a pilot with the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
Based at RAF Shawbury in the West Midlands, he lives with William, who is
training to become a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force (RAF).
</P>
<P>
"We hardly ever see each other. And now we are living together and it's
fantastic," Harry said in a syndicated interview.
</P>
<P>
"(William) does most of the cooking. I spend time just lying around, watching TV
and doing my work," he said, and joked: "The RAF don't have to work as hard as
the army."
</P>
<P>
William is reportedly giving his brother advice ahead of his first helicopter
flight in the coming weeks, and Harry admitted that he had found the training
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"The flying courses are so intense," he said, adding: "It's surprised me."
</P>
<P>
He said: "There's times when I thought, you know, I'm really not cut out for
this, mentally. I hope I've got the physical skills to fly a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"But mentally, there are the exams and everything. I mean, I can't do maths, I
gave that up when I left school, as anyone does at that age. But I've been
throwing myself back in the deep end."
</P>
<P>
Harry has recently returned from a two-day visit to New York, which he described
as a "nice break" from the training. It was his first trip abroad as official
representative of Buckingham Palace.

Football: Perez to take reins at Real Madrid again
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spanish construction magnate Florentino Perez will be sworn in as president of
Real Madrid again later on Monday as no other candidate stood against him before
the deadline, the club said.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old will be sworn in at the Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium at 1 pm
(1100 GMT), the club said in a statement posted on its website shortly after the
deadline of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired.
</P>
<P>
Several challengers who had been expected to oppose him pulled out or were not
able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million euros (81.1 million dollars)
required by the club to be able to run for president.
</P>
<P>
Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team and the world's
richest football club by revenues, from 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera
Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is
back" and said the team he would help build would be world beaters.
</P>
<P>
"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. We have set up a
strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers
who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has
reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become
coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian
playmaker Kaka.
</P>
<P>
Media reports also constantly speculate that Cristiano Ronaldo, Liverpool's
Spanish star Xabi Alonso and Bayern Munich's French star Franck Ribery will don
the all-white strip next term.
</P>
<P>
Real has been led on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda, who took the reins of
the club after Ramon Calderon stepped down in January following allegations that
he rigged voting at the club's last annual general assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
Had another candidate stood against Perez, elections for president -- normally
held every four years -- would have taken place on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Real's arch-rivals Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the
Spanish Cup this season under debutante coach Pep Guardiola.
</P>
<P>
But in an interview published Sunday in daily newspaper El Pais, Perez said
Barcelona's success this season "motivates me even more".
</P>
<P>
"I do not place any limit on myself," he told the newspaper, adding the club
"needs a revolution".
</P>
<P>
Real ended the season on Sunday with a 2-1 loss to lowly Osasuna.

Football: FIFA 'in compliance' with world anti-doping code - Blatter
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NASSAU, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World football's governing body has been notified that its policies are "totally
in compliance" with those of the World Anti-Doping Agency, apart from the issue
of reintegrating players after a suspension, FIFA president Joseph Blatter said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, speaking at the conclusion of FIFA executive committee meetings here,
said WADA had confirmed that "FIFA's disciplinary code and FIFA's anti-doping
code, is totally in compliance with the WADA code".
</P>
<P>
The lone exception, he said had to do with when suspended players can resume
training with their clubs.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said that FIFA's position is that a player
suspended for 12 months should be allowed to resume training after nine months.
</P>
<P>
FIFA and WADA had been at odds recently over WADA requirements on availablity of
players for out-of-competition drugs testing.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of January, the world anti-doping code requires elite
athletes to give notice of their location at a chosen one-hour period each day,
seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had contended that players should be subject to testing when with their
teams, but not when on holiday.
</P>
<P>
World anti-doping chief John Fahey said FIFA's stance "ignores the reality of
doping in sport."
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem between the WADA organization and FIFA," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
"The only problem that we had, which has now been put away ... is the question,
'Is WADA a service organization for the world of sport?' The answer is yes. WADA
is not a police organization."

Abortion doctor shot dead in Kansas church
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities here on Sunday arrested a suspect in the death of a controversial
provider of late-term abortions, who was fatally shot as he walked into services
at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abortion doctor George Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT)
in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama expressed outrage at the fatal shooting of the
controversial doctor, in a statement released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some
three hours after the killing. Local media identified the suspect as a 51-year-
old man, who would be returned to Wichita to be charged.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters. "These things should not occur at a any
time."
</P>
<P>
Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67,
over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being
killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tiller's was one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-
term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the
mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Obama has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
His family released a statement saying Tiller "dedicated his life to providing
women with high-quality heath care despite frequent threats and violence,"
according to the local KWCH TV station.
</P>
<P>
"We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a
dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Tiller had been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested outside
his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building. In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller
recovered, and his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>

He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.

Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of

Football: Perez returns to presidency of Real Madrid - club

MADRID, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florentino Perez will be sworn in once again as president of Real Madrid on
Monday since no other candidate stood against him before the deadline for
applications passed, the club said.
</P>
<P>
"The new president of Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, will be sworn in on
Monday," the club said in a statement posted on its website after the deadline
of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired.
</P>
<P>
Several challengers who had been expected to oppose the 62-year-old construction
magnate pulled out or were not able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million
euros (81.1 million dollars) with the club required to be able to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team, from 2000 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera
Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
Real has been led on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda, who took the reins of
the club after Ramon Calderon stepped down in January following allegations that
he rigged voting at the club's last annual general assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
Had another candidate stood against Perez, elections for president -- normally
held every four years -- would have taken place on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Real's arch-rivals Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the
Spanish Cup this season under debutante coach Pep Guardiola.

President Barack Obama expressed outrage on Sunday at the fatal shooting of a
controversial Kansas doctor who performed late-term abortions, in a statement
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of
Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. A suspect was arrested three
hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years Tiller had been picketed, bombed and shot in both of his arms by
anti-abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.

US seeks slower Lat Am rapprochement with Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton began a visit to Central America Sunday, amid
new US steps toward ties with Cuba that Washington hopes will slow a sudden
regional push to end Havana's isolation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton landed in San Salvador from Washington where a senior State Department
official announced that Cuba had agreed to resume talks with the United States
on migration and direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
The chief US diplomat is in El Salvador for Monday's inauguration of president-
elect Mauricio Funes before traveling to neighboring Honduras for Tuesday's
general assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
The OAS is beset by a row over the pace of normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama's administration insists Cuba release political prisoners
and improve political freedoms before it is readmitted to the 35-member
organization. Some OAS states however want Cuba readmitted right away.
</P>
<P>
A senior US official, who is traveling with Clinton, told reporters that Havana
informed Washington on Saturday that it will take up the US offer to resume
long-stalled talks on migration issues and on direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Cubans have to determine a mutually convenient place and time," he
added on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of
additional dialogue," such as in counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, hurricane
and disaster preparedness response.
</P>
<P>
US officials said May 23 that the Obama admistration had proposed to resume the
discussions on migration issues, wihch had been conducted every two years until
they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
It was also Washington that proposed recently to resume direct mail service, the
official said, adding mail has for years, if not decades, been sent between the
United States and Cuba through a third country.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the new steps to engage Cuba would affect the OAS meeting in San
Pedro Sula, the senior official said "it is hoped ... that the region will
recognize that anything done within the ambit of the OAS ... should support and
foster this development, as opposed to hinder it."
</P>
<P>
US officials earlier declined to even rule out the possibility of Clinton's
skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for
bringing Cuba back within the OAS.
</P>
<P>
Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to
use the issue to either push for a lifting of the US embargo on Havana or for
their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since a popular Obama took office in January, analysts say, he has raised hopes
among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo, even if
he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the new steps, the Obama administration has called past US policy a
failure and moved to repair ties with Cuban President Raul Castro, who
officially took over the reins from older brother Fidel last year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Obama lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on Cuban-Americans
with relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, analyst Michael Shifter said, the
Obama team would have preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with
leftist but pragmatic democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to
power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist
guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil
war.
</P>
<P>
US Congressman Eliot Engel, who chairs a subcommittee on Western hemisphere
affairs who is traveling with Clinton, saw Clinton's visit to El Salvador as
halting a lurch in Latin America toward the extreme left.
</P>
<P>
"I think it means we want to engage with El Salvador because we don't them
drifting all the way left," Engel told reporters.

Football: FIFA seek guarantees from Nigeria on Under-17 readiness
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FIFA officials will visit Nigeria in June seeking government guarantees that
this year's Under-17 World Cup can be staged as planned, world football's
governing body said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said a commission led by FIFA vice
president Jack Warner will travel to Nigeria on June 11 and will meet Nigerian
Vice President Jonathan Goodluck in Lagos to request binding government
guarantees that Nigeria will fulfill all requirements for hosting the
competition.
</P>
<P>
"If these guarantees are given, the six venues will be Abuja, Calabar, Enugu,
Ijebu-Ode, Kano and Lagos," FIFA said in a statement. "Should the guarantees not
be issued, FIFA would withdraw the organization of this tournament from Nigeria
and an alternative host nation would be found."
</P>
<P>
FIFA's ultimatum came at the end of executive committee meetings here.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, from an objective point of view, Nigeria is not ready to host the
tournament," Warner, who is chairman of FIFA's organizing committee for the
under-17 World Cup, said in Lagos on May 21 after inspecting the prospective
venues.
</P>
<P>
"But I am a man who has always believed in Nigeria and there have been some
signs of hope and commitment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Warner said that only the match venues in Abuja and Lagos were ready, but
recommended a one-month grace period for the other problems to be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
The Under-17 World Cup is scheduled to start on October 24.

GM set for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure
General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join
rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President
Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after the auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news
conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US
automaker would file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The developments came as creditors holding about 54 percent of General's Motors
bonds approved a restructuring plan proposed by the US Treasury, a spokesman for
the bondholders said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 54 percent represented 975 institutions, a spokesman for the ad hoc
committee of bondholders, Elliot Sloane told AFP. Washington had warned that if
the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing everything.
</P>
<P>
The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor
costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars
as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into
its pockets for the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the
government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that
path.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on number
three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a
new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate
the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue
plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM
and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Mauritania coup chief campaigns as talks mull vote delay
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NOUAKCHOTT, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of last year's coup in Mauritania began a final push for votes Sunday
in the week ahead of scheduled elections as his aides took part in talks about a
possible delay to the polls.
</P>
<P>
On a trip to the north, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pledged to improve
living standards in the poverty-stricken nation if he returns to power after the
scheduled June 6 ballot which he is widely expected to win.
</P>
<P>
But with the main opposition boycotting next weekend's polls as little more than
a sham, much of the attention was focused on neighbouring Senegal where
international mediators are convening talks aimed at resolving the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
According to the state news agency, Aziz pledged during a campaign appearance in
the northern Atar region to work to bring about "an improvement in living
standards for every citizen, in particular the most vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
Aziz also promised to upgrade facilities in all the country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the opposition said that the talks in Dakar were focusing on a
proposal to delay the first round of the elections until July 21 with the second
round taking place on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Aziz denounced talk of a delay in the polls over the weekend as "rumours and
lies", but the head of the main opposition party, Ahmed Ould Daddah, said that a
deal "had existed".
</P>
<P>
"Its witnesses are numerous and credible, including representatives of the
international community and Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade," Daddah said.
</P>
<P>
"An unwritten agreement was reached 48 hours ago with the Ould Abdel Aziz camp,
but we see since then a desire from that camp to backpedal on key points," said
the leader of the Rally of Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
A draft accord being discussed in the Senegalese capital Dakar would also see
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was toppled in last August's coup, formally resign as
president after signing a decree to usher in a transitional period under a
temporary government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks began in Dakar last Thursday and resumed on Sunday morning
with Senegal's Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio saying he was convinced
that the talks would end with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamara, the United
Nations special representative for West Africa Said Djinnit and the US and
French ambassadors to Senegal are also participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz initially took power in the northwest African nation in August
last year as head of a military junta which toppled Cheikh Abdallahi, the
country's first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
He then quit the military in April to run for president in a move widely seen as
a ploy to legitimise the coup. The former junta chief is running against only
three other marginal candidates who have all supported the coup.

Football: FIFA unveil 2014 Brazil World Cup venues

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Blatter, president of world football's governing body FIFA, on Sunday
unveiled the name of the 12 venue cities for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after two days of FIFA executive committee meetings in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
As expected, five major cities will host games, including the capital Brasilia
(Mane Garrincha stadium), Rio de Janeiro (Maracana), Sao Paulo (Morumbi), Belo
Horizonte (Mineirao) and Porto Alegre (Beira-Rio).
</P>
<P>
Three cities where the stadia must be built were also selected: Natal (Estrela
dos Reis Magos), Recife-Olinda (Arena Recife-Olinda) and Salvador (Arena da
Bahia).
</P>
<P>
In the competition to represent the Amazon, which makes up 43 percent of
Brazil's territory, Manaus (Vivaldao) beat out Belem.
</P>
<P>
The other venue cities are Curitiba (Arena da Baixada), Cuiaba (Verdao) and
Fortaleza (Castelao).
</P>
<P>
"There are no winning and losing cities here in Brazil," said Brazilian Football
Federation president Ricardo Terra Teixeira. "For the 12 privileged cities
chosen, it's the beginning of the work. They have a huge responsibility"
</P>
<P>
The 12 cities were chosen from 17 candidates, after inspections carried out in
January and February and based on their accessibility, infrastructure and
potential security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Florianopolis, Goiania, Campo Grande, Belem and Rio Branco all missed out.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult decision to choose just 12 venues from the initial list
of 17," Blatter said. "We want to make this World Cup a sporting success and
this is the most important thing."
</P>
<P>
FIFA had already agreed to have 12 venues rather than 10 because of the size of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Rio's legendary Maracana hosted the final of the last World Cup held in Brazil,
in 1950, when Uruguay defeated the hosts 2-1 for the title.

New therapies to treat breast, lymph cancer: studies
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORLANDO, Florida, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New therapies developed following groundbreaking clinical trials appear to
effectively target breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to
research unveiled Sunday at a major cancer conference.
</P>
<P>
The first therapy targeting the capacity of cancer cells to repair themselves
shows promise in treating breast cancer, according to results of two small
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
The new agent, especially adept at targeting cancers that are most difficult to
cure, neutralizes an enzyme called PARP (poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase) and
prevents it from playing its usual role in repairing the DNA of damaged cells.
</P>
<P>
Like healthy cells, cancerous cells employ PARP to regenerate themselves after
they have been damaged by chemo-therapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
The studies examined whether breast cancers are more susceptible to chemotherapy
when the PARP enzymes have been neutralized.
</P>
<P>
The first clinical trial was conducted with 116 women suffering from so-called
triple negative breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
These involve fast-spreading tumors that account for 15 percent of the 170,000
annual cases worldwide of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Some of the cases were treated with chemotherapy and a PARP inhibitor called
BSI-201 made by the firm BiPar Sciences, a US affiliate of the French-owned
laboratory Sanofi-Aventis.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the group was treated only with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
After six months, about 62 percent of the patients treated with BSI-201 combined
with chemotherapy showed a comparative clinical improvement of 21 percent over
the control group, said Joyce O'Shaughnessy, of the Baylor-Charles Sammons
cancer center in Dallas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
She presented the results of the study at a conference of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology this weekend in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The women treated with BSI-201 survived 9.2 months on average, including 6.9
months in which the cancer did not spread, compared to an average survival of
6.9 months and 3.3 months in which the cancer was in check for those who were
treated solely with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The second clinical study involved 54 women suffering from advanced breast
cancer linked to the gene mutation BRCA1 or BRCA2. They were treated with the
PARP blocker Olaparib made by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical AstraZenica.
There was no control group.
</P>
<P>
The test showed that 40 percent of the patients who took the drug experienced a
reduction in their tumors, said Andrew Tutt, a cancer specialist at Kings
College in London.
</P>
<P>
In another study presented here researchers examined a vaccine on patients over
eight years that targeted follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a particularly
aggressive form of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study found that patients who received the BiovaxID vaccine experienced on
average disease-free survival of approximately 44 months, compared to about 30
months for patients who received a control vaccine -- an increase of 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BiovaxID vaccine is patient-specific, in that each dose must be individually
manufactured from tissue obtained from a patient's own cancerous tumor.
</P>
<P>
"With this vaccine, we've now moved into an era where we can safely use a
patient's immune system to effectively fight follicular lymphoma and enhance the
response to conventional chemotherapy" said lead study author Stephen Schuster.
</P>
<P>
"Because this vaccine uniquely recruits the patient's immune system to seek and
destroy only tumor B-cells, this approach may be applicable to the treatment of
other B-cell lymphomas," Schuster added.

Nigeria troops destroy militant camp: spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAGOS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigeria's army said Sunday it had destroyed a rebel camp in southern Rivers
state as part of its campaign to end years of violence and kidnappings in the
oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of Joint Task Force (JTF) have located and destroyed a militants'
camp close to Buguma creek in Rivers State after a fierce exchange of fire with
the militants," army spokesman Rabe Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of JTF were fired at from the militants' camp over night and the
security outfit has no choice but to locate and destroy the camp," he said in an
e-mail to AFP.
</P>
<P>
He said the military would get "rid of the criminals who are bent on causing
unnecessary tension and apprehension in the region".
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the military also recovered some arms and ammunition during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
Several camps operated by militants have been destroyed since May 13 when
federal troops launched their operation against fighters of the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Nigeria's main militant group.
</P>
<P>
But MEND said in a statement late Sunday there was no fresh attack on its camp
at Buguma.
</P>
<P>
"The leader of a small group of fighters around the Buguma creek axis in Rivers
state, Egbele has confirmed that there was no attack in his camp as claimed by
the military JTF," the group said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Egbele) said they actually asked him to cooperate by giving the impression
his camp has been over-run," MEND added.
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half years MEND, which says it is fighting to ensure
local people have a greater share in the oil wealth, has been behind a series of
kidnappings of staff and attacks on oil installations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in the Niger Delta has reduced Nigeria's daily output to 1.76 million
barrels compared with 2.6 million barrels in January 2006.

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities here on Sunday arrested a suspect in the death of a controversial
provider of late-term abortions, who was fatally shot as he walked into services
at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abortion doctor George Tiller, was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT)
in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some
three hours after the killing, and said they would have more details about the
alleged shooter at a press conference planned for 4 pm local time (2100 GMT
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These things should not occur at a any time."
</P>
<P>
Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67,
over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being
killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common
ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of
the top Catholic universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested
outside his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of
federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in
1994 that listed Tiller as the top target.
</P>
<P>
Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United
States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that
would be viable outside the mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
Tiller was acquitted of having an illegal financial relationship with the doctor
who provided the second opinion.

First president of Guinea-Bissau dies aged 78
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BISSAU, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Cabral, the first post-independence president of Guinea-Bissau who was
later toppled in a military coup, has died of a heart attack in Lisbon,
officials announced on Sunday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
"It is with shock and sadness that the government and people of Guinea-Bissau
have learnt of the loss of one of their most illustrious sons, Luis Cabral," the
government announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government was to hold an emergency session to organise preparations for a
three-day period of national mourning, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources Minister Oscar Barbosa, a close ally of the former president,
said that Cabral had died of a heart attack in the Portuguese capital on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Cabral was a half-brother of Amilcar Cabral, long-time leader of the
Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) liberation movement, who was
assassinated in 1973 -- the year before Guinea-Bissau attained its independence
from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Cabral ruled in Guinea-Bissau until he was overthrown in a coup led by "First
Commissar", or prime minister, Joao Bernardo Vieira on November 14, 1980.
</P>
<P>
After his ouster, Cabral was imprisoned for six months before being released
after the intervention of the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
He then spent most of the rest of his life in exile in Portugal, although he did
make a brief return to Guinea-Bissau 1999 after Vieira was toppled in another
coup.
</P>
<P>
News of his death comes less than three months after Vieira, who returned to
power in 2005 elections, was assassinated by soldiers in the hours after a bomb
attack which claimed the life of the West African country's military chief.

British PM says won't quit as poll predicts Euro election rout
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a
scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party
before crunch European and local elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the expenses furore, which has shown how lawmakers claimed from the
public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island, was "appalling"
and "offends everything that I believe in".
</P>
<P>
Every member of parliament would be forced to account for all their expenses
from the last four years, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said
they will resign since the Daily Telegraph newspaper began publishing the leaked
claims three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested the revelations would hit Brown hard
at the European and local elections, in which Britons vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It suggested Labour would come third in the elections for the European
Parliament with just 17 percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and the
smaller centrist Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general
election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in
an opinion poll since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the
expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who must call a general election by the middle of next year,
dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader.
</P>
<P>
"Things go up and down," he said in an interview with BBC television. "We're
going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced.
</P>
<P>
"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers'
money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a
difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession.
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was
looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, lowering the
voting age to 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the
BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs".
</P>
<P>
Public anger over expenses is widespread and in a sermon Sunday, the leader of
the Scottish Catholic church expressed concern at the "fall from grace" of many
people in politics, saying "money (was) at the root of many difficulties".
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Keith O'Brien called on "those in public service of whatever kind who
have failed us to reclaim the high standards which we expect of them".
</P>
<P>
Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low, due partly to
widespread Eurosceptic sentiment, and in 2004 turnout was just 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
This time, fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far-
right British National Party are expected to benefit. Commentators say the BNP
could even win its first seat at the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of
Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to
37 percent who think it is bad.
</P>
<P>
ICM interviewed 1,013 adults by telephone May 27-28 for the Sunday Telegraph
poll, while YouGov questioned 2,322 adults in Britain May 22-26.

Football: Betis relegated after Osasuna, Sporting heroics
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real Betis were relegated from the Spanish top-flight on a heart-breaking final
Sunday of the season, drawing 1-1 at home to Valladolid while relegation rivals
Osasuna and Sporting Gijon both won.
</P>
<P>
Betis started a point above the drop zone knowing a win would keep them in the
top tier but Sporting's 2-1 comeback win over Recreativo Huelva coupled with
Osasuna's sensational 2-1 victory against nine-man Real Madrid saw them
relegated with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
Betis, who are based in the southern city of Seville, were last relegated in
2000 but immediately won promotion the following season and have been in the
first division since 2001, finishing as high as fourth in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad day because once again the football gods weren't on our side," said
Betis coach Jose Maria Nogues. "Betis now have to get back in the top division
for its fans and history."
</P>
<P>
Getafe, who drew 1-1 with Racing Santander, also finished on 42 points but
stayed up on goal difference while Valladolid's draw at Betis was enough to keep
them safe.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly tough for Betis duo Sergio Garcia and Ricardo Oliveira, who
cost a combined 19 million euros after being relegated with Real Zaragoza last
season.
</P>
<P>
At half-time Sporting Gijon, trailing Recre 1-0, were set to be relegated but
came back to win 2-1 and secure their top-flight status.
</P>
<P>
Sporting had spent a decade in the second division before winning promotion last
season and defied the odds to stay up with Luis Moran scoring a dramatic winner.
</P>
<P>
"It was an agonising game that felt like seven days," said Sporting coach Manolo
Preciado. "Our fans are special and their contribution throughout this season
has been pivotal."
</P>
<P>
Osasuna were third from bottom before kick off and fell behind against Real
Madrid when Gonzalo Higuain scored early on.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Camacho's men battled back, equalising through Jaroslav Plasil
before Juanfran smashed a stunning volley past Iker Casillas to keep them in the
division.
</P>
<P>
"We reached our target although it was a bit last minute," said Camacho.
"It is clear that Osasuna need to reconstruct the squad a bit because for the
past two seasons we have been fighting for survival on the final weekends of the
season."
</P>
<P>
Michel Salgado and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were both sent off for Real, who crashed
to a fifth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain
Raul Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th-minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol's new Cornella-El Prat stadium looked destined to host second-division
football next season before the club produced a sensational late run to beat the
drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games played Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from
safety, but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and a burst
of form saw the club win eight out of their ten final games.
</P>
<P>
Malaga coach Antonio Tapia confirmed that he would not be in charge of the club
next season, saying that the time was right to step down.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be coach next season," said Tapia. "After an excellent season I think
it is the ideal time for my family and I to end this chapter in my life."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game with little at
stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League by finishing third and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia will prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of
their campaign a 1-0 victory over treble-winners Barcelona in Soria on the
opening day of the season.

Golf: Frenchman Cevaer shocks field to win European Open
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France's Christian Cevaer, ranked a lowly 449th in the world, shocked a strong
field to win the European Open here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After four rounds of golf that saw 45 changes of the lead, the 39-year-old
Frenchman, who has failed to make the top-30 in his last 15 starts and whose
only previous Tour victory was the 2004 Spanish Open, beat England's Steve
Webster, Scot Gary Orr and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros by a shot.
</P>
<P>
His winning total of 281, seven under par, was 13 strokes more than Ross Fisher
took on the same London Club course last year - and his 74 was the highest last
round by a winner all season.
</P>
<P>
But while Webster and Quiros both became more victims of the 471-yard last when
tied for the lead - both carved their drives into the crowd, with Quiros hitting
spectators with his first and second shots - Cevaer kept his nerve.
</P>
<P>
During the week the par four played to an average of nearly 4.7, with 154
bogeys, 48 doubles and 26 sevens or worse, but Cevaer parred it the first two
days, birdied it in the third round and finished with the par he needed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a long player, but I used my utility club and it worked out great," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I made a point that no matter what happened just enjoy my golf, enjoy my skills
and hang in there."
</P>
<P>
He played the front nine in 39 and did not have a birdie until the long 15th,
but the problems meant that it brought him back into a share of top spot.
</P>
<P>
And then three closing pars were good enough to give him the 300,000 pounds
first prize - easily the biggest of his 16-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
At 196th on the "Race to Dubai" money list entering the week he would have been
delighted just to secure his card for next season, but now he has a five-year
Tour exemption.

Overnight leader Jeev Milkha Singh of India was still at the top of the
leaderboard in the European Open after windy conditions took a toll of scores at
the London Club in Kent on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Singh shot a one under par 71 to leave him in the joint lead with France's
Christian Cevaer who went one better with a round of 70.
</P>
<P>
But hot on their heels was 20-year-old rising star Rory McIlroy who caught the
eye with a four-under-par 68 that saw the Northern Irishman close to within
three shots of the leading duo after he'd been in 25th place overnight.
</P>
<P>
Alongside McIlroy in joint third place were England's Chris Wood and Spain's
Alvaro Quiros.
</P>
<P>
Singh, the world number 39, defied the conditions to cover the final six holes
in a superb four under par on a day where Spain's Sergio Garcia was one of
several players to finish with a triple bogey seven.
</P>
<P>
Before his round Singh said it was vital for the progress of golf in India that
it became an Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
"Golf not being an Olympic sport we have not been getting any funding from the
government," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully in October it does and I think what happens after that is the
government is going to allocate land in each and every city to have a public
driving range so that a normal human being can go there and try a hand at it.
</P>
<P>
"That's when it's going to be really big in our country. It's the fastest-
growing sport in our country, but it's the only way this game is going to get
famous and close to cricket.
</P>
<P>
"Our population is more than a billion and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of
talent out there.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a public driving range in our country and there's only
one public golf course right now. Everything is private.
</P>
<P>
"I remember there were a lot of good players when I was growing up who just
didn't take it up - they just went back to the parents' business."
</P>
<P>
Last week McIlroy shot 65 at Wentworth before falling back in the final round
and it appears injury may have been a factor, although it seems as if he is
getting close to finding a cure.
</P>
<P>
McIlroy, who revealed he'd been struggling with a "little niggle" in his back,
said: "I had a really nice bath last night, got into bed and watched the golf in
the States. I'm a bit of a golf geek to be honest."

South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to
sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on
the Georgian rebel region.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the
mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow
and Tbilisi and is recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse
Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were second with 23.51 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Final results were due at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the
turnout at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the
central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
The name of Unity also bears more than a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling
party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia
party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as
independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia
should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the
region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. We are
working and working now. I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an
interview with AFP.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also
accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity
for his leadership during the August conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years
for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying
the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in
the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are
now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results.
</P>
<P>
As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.

A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South
Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results

</P>
<P>
The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should
allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel

GM set for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure
General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join
rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President
Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news
conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US
automaker would file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt
according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee.
Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing
everything.
</P>
<P>
Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor
costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars
as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into its
pockets for the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the
government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that
path.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Monday New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on
number three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a
new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate
the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue
plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM
and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Waste piles up in Sicily as collectors strike
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
palermo, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sicily's city of Palermo was buried in a mountain of waste on Sunday as garbage
collectors pressed on with a strike over fears that their struggling employer
will not pay them.
</P>
<P>
Piles of trash as high as two metres (6 feet 5 inches) lined apartment buildings
and church walls across the city, as firefighters received reports of some 200
rubbish fires sparked by hot temperatures on the island.
</P>
<P>
Garbagemen have been on strike or have done limited trash pick-ups as they
refuse to work overtime for fear of not getting paid by their employer, the
trash collection company Amia, which is 150 million euros in the hole.
</P>
<P>
The city council dropped Sunday a plan to raise the waste management tax by 30
percent to help Amia after a stormy municipal meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Diego Cammarata said the strike was "seriously irresponsible" as the city
was more and more "invaded by trash in an intolerable and indecent way."
</P>
<P>
The collectors' union decided to remain on strike until they received guarantees
on the future of their employer.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded better work equipment, saying that they were not working in
safe conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike recalls the rubbish problems that have hit Naples, where the mafia
has been blamed for a garbage crisis in a city that has been on a "waste state
of emergency" for 14 years.

Yachting: Volvo race changes rules to attract more women
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Galway, Ireland, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race announced Sunday changes to the next edition
of the round-the-world yacht race aimed at boosting the number of women who take
part.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 36-year history of the event, formerly called the
Whitbread race, no women sailors are taking part in the 2008-09 edition of the
race, which involves eight teams and began in Alicante, Spain in October.
</P>
<P>
Organisers decided that female teams will be allowed to carry 12 sailors, two of
whom may be men, instead of just 10 for an all male team during the next edition
of the world's most grueling offshore yacht race scheduled for 2011-12.
</P>
<P>
The change in the rules for the crew make-up for the next race was "an effort to
encourage female participation", they said in a statement following a meeting in
Galway, Ireland where current race entries have made a stop.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say female entries have disappeared from the race due to the
selection of the more powerful Volvo Open 70 yachts in 2004, which are longer
and require more physical force to control than the old Ocean 60 yachts that
were used before.
</P>
<P>
"These boats are animals," said Lisa McDonald, who attempted to raise a mixed
campaign for the last race with her husband Neal after skippering Amer Sports
Too in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"They are wild and furious and pretty powerful so until there is a new rule, it
is difficult to imagine girls being competitive in them," she told the Volvo
Ocean Race website in January.
</P>
<P>
The organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race also announced several other changes for
future editions designed to make the race more competitive and less costly.
</P>
<P>
The maximum weight for the keel fin and bulb of participating yachts in the
future will be set at 7,400 kilogrammes and headfoils will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Organisers are also looking to ban two-boat testing which favours teams with
bigger budgets. One of Swedish team Ericsson's two entries in the ongoing Volvo
Ocean Race, the Ericsson 4, currently leads the overall classification.
</P>
<P>
Volvo is seeking to make it possible for a team to be competitive with a budget
of between 15-20 million euros in future race. They hope lower costs will
attract about a dozen teams, instead of the 7 or 8 in recent editions.
</P>
<P>
The current Volvo Ocean Race is to conclude in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in June
after negotiating 10 stages over 37,000 nautical miles.

Millvina Dean, the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in

</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Gladys Dean, known to friends as Millvina, was only nine weeks old

She survived after being bundled up in a sack and carried to safety. Her mother
Georgette Eva and brother Bertram also made it, but her father, Bertram Frank,
was among those who died.
</P>
<P>
Dean died in a private nursing home near Ashurst in the southern English county
of Hampshire, according to the BBC and Britain's domestic Press Association news
agency. Staff there refused to comment late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dean's family had boarded the Titanic at Southampton, heading for a new life in
Kansas where her father hoped to open a tobacconist shop.
</P>
<P>
Born on February 12, 1912, Dean was the youngest passenger on board. At the
time, RMS Titanic was the most luxurious, most technically advanced and largest
passenger liner in the world.
</P>
<P>
She was dubbed "unsinkable", but it took just two hours and 40 minutes for her
to disappear into the icy waters of the Atlantic after striking an iceberg at
11:40 pm on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Dean was taken back to Southampton with her family after the disaster and did
not find out that she had been on board until she was eight years old and her
mother was planning to remarry.
</P>
<P>
According to enthusiasts' website Encyclopedia Titanica (ET), Dean worked for
the government as a cartographer during World War II and then for an engineering
company.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that it was not until the wreckage of the liner was found in
1985 that she suddenly became a celebrity, taking part in documentaries and
giving media interviews.
</P>
<P>
Dean was invited to complete her family's ill-fated journey to the United States
in 1997 aboard the QE2, and accepted, although she turned down an offer to
attend the premier of the movie "Titanic" because it would be too upsetting.
</P>
<P>
She moved into a private nursing home in Hampshire after breaking her hip three
years ago, and after struggling to pay the bills was forced to sell off some of
her memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
At auction in October 2008 she raised 31,150 pounds (40,000 euros, 53,900
dollars), selling off rare prints of the liner signed by the artists as well as
compensation letters sent to her mother by the Titanic Relief Fund.
</P>
<P>
Dean was also forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes donated
to her family by the people of New York when they arrived after being rescued.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the auction, friends including members of the British Titanic
Society and the Belfast Titanic Society -- the liner was built in Belfast in
Northern Ireland-- set up a campaign to secure her future.
</P>
<P>
Among the donors to the Millvina Fund were Hollywood actors Kate Winslet and
Leonardo DiCaprio, who starred in the 1997 "Titanic" film. The pair and the
film's director, James Cameron, reportedly donated 30,000 US dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining US survivor, Lillian Asplund, died in her home in May 2006 at
the age of 99. She was just five years old when the Titanic went down.

Support for EU treaty rising in ailing Ireland: poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
dublin, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Support for the European Union's Lisbon treaty is consolidating in recession-hit
Ireland, according to a poll released Sunday, ahead of a second referendum
likely to be held by October.
</P>
<P>
The TNS mrbi poll for Monday's Irish Times found support has increased by two
points to 54 percent on a similar survey a fortnight ago, while the percentage
of "no" voters has fallen one point to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen percent said they did not know, down one point.
</P>
<P>
In a shock result in a referendum last June, 53.4 percent voted "no" and 46.6
percent voted "yes", sparking a major crisis in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 EU nations, only Ireland is constitutionally bound to hold a
referendum on the treaty, which is designed to improve decision-making in a
greatly expanded bloc. It must be ratified by all member states.
</P>
<P>
Dublin is seeking a number of guarantees from Brussels, including on the right
to make its own laws on tax, defence and abortion, before holding another vote,
likely before the end of the October.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Times said the "yes" side has maintained a consistent and steadily
growing lead in its three polls since the beginning of 2009, despite a collapse
in support for the coalition government of Prime Minister Brian Cowen.
</P>
<P>
The former Celtic Tiger economy has been devastated by the financial crisis, and
voters were asked if, in the light of the recession, they thought it was better
to be part of the EU.
</P>
<P>
A substantial 81 percent thought it was (up two points), 10 percent thought it
was not (no change) and nine percent had no opinion (down two).
</P>
<P>
The pollsters interviewed 2,000 voters face-to-face between May 26 and 28.

Recession-hit Croatia votes in local polls
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in recession-hit Croatia cast ballots in the second round of local and
regional elections on Sunday seen as a referendum on the governing coalition's
handling of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Partial results released several hours after polls closed at 7:00pm (1700 GMT)
showed that the main opposition Social Democrats were set to retain power in the
capital Zagreb as their candidate and incumbent mayor was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Milan Bandic, seeking his fourth term, garnered 61.74 percent of the votes,
according to results from 573 out of 601 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
But in the second city of Split, on the central Adriatic coast, independent
Zeljko Kerum appeared set for victory, according to partial results.
</P>
<P>
The polls gave some four million voters the right for the first time to directly
elect mayors, county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county
assemblies and more than 550 city and town councils.
</P>
<P>
Although a final figure was not yet available, turnout appeared to be low with
the electoral commission saying that 26.53 percent of the electorate had voted
by 1400 GMT.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's ruling conservative Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) was re-elected in most counties in the first round while the SDP
asserted their control in major cities.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ and its coalition partners won seven prefect posts and held a majority
in 14 out of 21 county assemblies. The SDP got four county prefects and secured
control of five county assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in
more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right-
wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ, founded by late nationalist leader Franjo Tudjman, returned to power in
2003 after three years in opposition. Sanader has since shaken off the HDZ's
hardline nationalist legacy and transformed it into a party that is aiming to
lead Croatia to becoming the European Union's 28th member by 2011.

Fiji won the final leg of the IRB World Sevens Series here on Sunday with a
20-19 victory over South Africa, who were crowned overall champions.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's win saw them leapfrog England into second place in the final standings,
but a full 30 points behind South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Paul Treu's side finish the season with 132 points, ahead of Fiji (102), England
(98), New Zealand (88), Argentina (68) and Kenya (64).
</P>
<P>
In a breathless final Emosi Vucago put the Fijians ahead but Ryno Benjamin's
converted score edged the Boks ahead 7-5.
</P>

The islanders rebounded with tries from Pio Tuwai and Osea Kolinisau for a 15-7
half-time lead.
</P>

In the second half Vereniki Goneva looked to have put the game beyond doubt as
Fiji dominated for large periods but Gio Aplon scored and then, at 20-12 down,
Renfred Dazel broke free in midfield and raced away to score another.

<P>
An Iraqi sports reporter was killed and a television host wounded on Sunday when
a bomb attached to the victim's car exploded in the northern city of Mosul, a
police official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed Alaa Abdul Wahab, a correspondent for the Al-Baghdadia channel
and a leading newspaper journalist, and wounded Dr Sultan Jurjis, a university
academic and sports presenter with a rival TV station.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Abdul Wahab was killed and Dr Jurjis was injured when a sticky bomb put in
the former's car exploded," said a Mosul police official.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off in Al-Shurta district in the north of Mosul, 370 kilometres

</P>
<P>
Mosul remains plagued by violence despite security improvements in many other
areas of Iraq. Elements from Al-Qaeda and former insurgents who have fled other
parts of the country regularly carry out attacks in the city.

GM poised for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Barack Obama discuss General Motor's bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported Sunday that Obama will explain the rationale for the filing and his
hopes that the bankruptcy filing offers the best hope for the company's
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
The president's administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt
according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee.
</P>
<P>
GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, also has scheduled a news conference
for midday Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
General Motors got a boost Sunday as holders of more than half its bond debt
agreed to a US Treasury rescue plan that would create a new company shorn of
labor costs and money losing assets.
</P>
<P>
The rescue could reach 60 billion dollars with the state taking a 72.5 per cent
ownership stake in the 101 year old company. Canada, which has several GM
factories, also will be digging into its pockets.
</P>
<P>
The new Treasury rescue plan would give bondholders up to 25 percent of the
company. Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked
losing everything.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in bankruptcy court, but
the government has warned they could end up with little or nothing if they take
that path.
</P>
<P>
The New York bankruptcy court also is expected to rule Monday on number three US
automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, judge Arthur Gonzales was expected to approve the
creation of a new Chrysler, called 'New Carco,' which would preserve the
automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big
mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler
out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to
sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on
the Georgian rebel region.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the
mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow
and Tbilisi and is recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse
Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost eight percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were third with 14.6 percent of the vote. Final results were due
at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the turnout at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the
central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
The name of Unity also bears more that a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling
party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia
party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as
independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia
should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the
region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. We are
working and working now. I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an
interview with AFP.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also
accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity
for his leadership during the August conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years
for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying
the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in
the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are
now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results.
</P>
<P>
As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.

Israel's Barak visits US in bid to heal rift
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak will try to heal a growing rift with his
country's main ally over the Middle East peace process when he starts talks with
top officials in the United States on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is likely to devote a lot of time to easing tensions, although the talks
were originally planned to focus mainly on bilateral defence ties and US-led
international efforts to halt Iran's nuclear drive, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day trip, he is expected to meet Vice President Joe Biden,
Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, National Security Adviser James Jones and
President Barack Obama's special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The defence chief is also expected to discuss US arms sales to Israel, including
a request for it to buy up to 75 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in a deal worth as
much as 15.2 billion dollars and other advanced weapon systems, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit comes just two weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held
his first meeting with Obama in Washington, revealing deep divisions over ways
to move forwards towards Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The hawkish premier sparked international criticism over his repeated refusal to
endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, a bedrock principle of
international peacemaking efforts over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have intensified, with Israel rejecting repeated US calls to halt all
settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, the major part of the proposed
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a former prime minister and head of the centre-left Labour party, aims to
use his personal ties to avert a crisis between Washington and Netanyahu's
right-leaning government, a senior official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear whether Barak will be able to ease the tensions as he
himself has said that Israel must maintain its right to continue building within
the boundaries of large settlement blocs.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the prime minister made Israel's positions and needs clear to the
US administration. The dialogue will take time and it will have many ups and
downs," the Labour leader has told reporters.
</P>
<P>
One official said Barak will propose that within a short time Israel would
dismantle dozens of illegal outposts in the West Bank if the United States lets
Israel go on building inside existing settlements to meet "natural growth."
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official complained that Obama -- who has vowed to pursue
Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- is
placing unfair demands on the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking
Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. These demands are unfair," he
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Despite discord over the Middle East peace talks, Obama eased Israeli concerns
over his efforts to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear programme in direct
negotiations, with the president saying the success of the dialogue would be
assessed by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
"This dialogue ought to be short and should have milestones to check whether it
is serious or not," Barak said recently. "I believe the chances that talks will
halt Iran's nuclear programme are very low."
</P>
<P>
The former chief of staff reiterated that Israel would not rule out military
action against nuclear sites in the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"Israel believes that no option should be removed from the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear
armed power, suspects Iran is using its nuclear programme to develop atomic
weapons, a charge Tehran has long denied.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting
spilled into a nearby tribal area.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the
top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that
three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was
impossible to estimate when the offensive would end.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot
give any timeframe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were
killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for
Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in
Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. The attack was repulsed successfully,
inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while
elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops
including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy.
</P>
<P>
Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but
the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded
by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it
was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants
around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding:
"We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat. The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the
offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify.
</P>
<P>
As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing
of a wave of revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's
suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive
attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military
relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to
allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the
situation in Swat Valley, after an ICRC team reported problems with running
water, food, electricty and communications.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance
immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional
resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our
teams to deliver."

Iraq delays Kirkuk election report by a week: MP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Baghdad, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final report on staging provincial elections in Iraq's disputed region of
Kirkuk has been delayed by another week because of disagreements among
commission members, an MP said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The commission on Sunday notified parliament speaker Iyad al-Samarrai that it
had not succeeded in reaching a compromise" acceptable to Kirkuk's Kurdish,
Turkmen and Arab communities, Mohammad Mahdi al-Bayati, a Turkmen member of the
commission, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Samarrai asked commission members "to continue their mission another week" and
said he will submit "his own suggestions for a solution," Bayati added.
</P>
<P>
Arabs and Turkmen oppose to any further extension beyond a week although the
Kurds have no objection, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission should have delivered its report on elections in the province by
mid-April, but the deadline was put back to the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Kirkuk, 250 kilometres (150 miles) north of the capital, has a
population of around 900,000.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and Turkmen communities want seats on the provincial council to be
divided into three equal blocs, but the Kurds say they form the majority of the
population and want better representation.
</P>
<P>
Intercommunal tensions prevented the staging of provincial elections in Kirkuk
on January 31, when the rest of Iraq except the three Kurdish provinces voted
for new councils.
</P>
<P>
The national parliament in Baghdad, backed by the United Nations, set up a
commission to look for a solution.

Bulgarians protest at Polish mother in tug-of-love saga
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
sofia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of Bulgarians protested Sunday outside the Polish embassy in Sofia to
voice their fury over a tug-of-love saga which saw an eight-year-old girl taken
back into the custody of her mother.
</P>
<P>
The crowd, numbering more than a thousand, denounced both Barbara Jadwigd, the
Polish mother of Nikoleta Vasilev, and embassy officials who helped her retrieve
the eight-year-old from her father's home in line with a court order.
</P>
<P>
Emotions have been running high since a report on the private Nova channel last
week showed how Jadwigd had dragged her sobbing daughter into an embassy car
outside her father's home in the southeastern Bulgarian town of Asenovgrad.
</P>
<P>
As Nikoleta screamed for help from her father and grandmother, her seven-year-
old brother Pavel managed to escape and is still missing.
</P>
<P>
Jadwigd had obtained custody rights in a court case after accusing the father,
Todor Vasilev, of kidnapping them from their home in Poland.
</P>
<P>
The father denied having taken the children to Bulgaria against their will, and
accused Jadwigd of being a poor parent.
</P>
<P>
Many Bulgarian politicians, including European Affairs Minister Gergana Passi,
have denounced the mother's behaviour while recognising the fact that a court
had indeed granted her the right to take them from the father.
</P>
<P>
The Polish embassy in Sofia meanwhile published a statement on its website
saying that it "regrets the fact that some media reports on this case are far
from objective ... and cause unnecessary emotions in the society that do not
contribute to solving the case."
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian court ruled at two instances that the children must be returned
to the place from which they were kidnapped, against the will and in the absence
of one of the parents," it added.

<P>
Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan won the 'pichichi' crown for the Spanish
league's top-scorer after finishing the season with 32 goals as his side
finished fourth to secure Champions League football.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan international Forlan, 30, finishes two goals above long-time leader,
Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o, to lift his second pichichi title having won it in
Villarreal's colours in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy because we qualified for the Champions League for the second
consecutive year and because I won the pichichi in a very strong Spanish
league," said Forlan.
</P>
<P>
Forlan, a 21-million-euro signing from Villarreal in 2007, hit a real purple
patch scoring in eight consecutive games to top the charts and become the first
player to score 30 goals in a season since Brazilian great Ronaldo netted 34
goals with Barcelona in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The goalscoring exploits of the former Manchester United man have reportedly
attracted interest from several clubs but Forlan has insisted he is happy at
Atletico where he is contracted until 2011.

Football: Betis relegated after Osasuna, Sporting heroics
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real Betis were relegated from the Spanish top-flight on a heart-breaking final
Sunday of the season, drawing 1-1 at home to Valladolid while relegation rivals
Osasuna and Sporting Gijon both won.
</P>
<P>
Betis started a point above the drop zone knowing a win would keep them in the
top tier but Sporting's 2-1 comeback win over Recreativo Huelva coupled with
Osasuna's sensational 2-1 victory against nine-man Real Madrid saw them
relegated with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
Betis, who are based in the southern city of Seville, were last relegated in
2000 but immediately won promotion the following season and have been in the
first division since 2001, finishing as high as fourth in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Getafe, who drew 1-1 with Racing Santander, also finished on 42 points but
stayed up on goal difference while Valladolid's draw at Betis was enough to keep
them safe.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly tough for Betis duo Sergio Garcia and Ricardo Oliveira, who
cost a combined 19 million euros after being relegated with Real Zaragoza last
season.
</P>
<P>
At half-time Sporting Gijon, trailing Recre 1-0, were set to be relegated but
came back to win 2-1 and secure their top-flight status.
</P>
<P>
Sporting had spent a decade in the second division before winning promotion last
season and defied the odds to stay up with Luis Moran scoring a dramatic winner.
</P>
<P>
Osasuna were third from bottom before kick off and fell behind against Real
Madrid when Gonzalo Higuain scored early on.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Camacho's men battled back, equalising through Jaroslav Plasil
before Juanfran smashed a stunning volley past Iker Casillas to keep them in the
division.
</P>
<P>
Michel Salgado and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were both sent off for Real, who crashed
to a fifth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain
Raul Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th-minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol's new Cornella-El Prat stadium looked destined to host second-division
football next season before the club produced a sensational late run to beat the
drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games played Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from
safety, but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and a burst
of form saw the club win eight out of their ten final games.
</P>
<P>
Malaga coach Antonio Tapia confirmed that he would not be in charge of the club
next season, saying that the time was right to step down.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be coach next season," said Tapia. "After an excellent season I think
it is the ideal time for my family and I to end this chapter in my life."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game with little at
stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League by finishing third and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia will prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of
their campaign a 1-0 victory over treble-winners Barcelona in Soria on the
opening day of the season.

Last Titanic survivor dies in England: BBC

<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millvina Dean, the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the Titanic, died
Sunday at a care home in England, the BBC reported, citing two of her friends.
She was 97.
</P>
<P>
Dean was a two-month-old baby and her family were emigrating to Kansas in the
United States when the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic
Ocean on its maiden voyage in 1912.
</P>
<P>
She was placed in a sack and carried to safety. Her mother and brother also
survived, but her father was among the 1,500 passengers and crew who died.
</P>
<P>
Two of Dean's unnamed friends told the BBC that she died at the care home in
Hampshire, in southern England. She had spent most of her life in Southampton in
the county of Hampton, from where the Titanic set out.
</P>
<P>
Dean had been struggling to pay the bills for her care home and in October 2008
raised 31,150 pounds (40,000 euros, 53,900 dollars) by auctioning off items from
the liner.
</P>
<P>
She was forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes which was
donated to her family by the people of New York when they arrived in the United
States after being rescued.
</P>
<P>
Rare prints of the liner signed by the artists along with compensation letters
sent to her mother by the Titanic Relief Fund also went under the hammer in
Devizes, southwest England.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining US survivor, Lillian Asplund, died in her home in May 2006 at
the age of 99. She was just five years old when the Titanic went down.

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable to be out of this competition and to have lost by three
goals today. My players have won so many trophies with me," a stunned Jose told
AFP at Coqueiros Stadium in the Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
"But, at the same time, the team was tired as we have just finished the Egyptian
championship and we also had three players missing on national duty in Oman.
</P>
<P>
"I am sad to have ended my time at Ahly in this way, but I have fantastic
memories. I love and respect the club so much and it was the best time in my
life as a coach."
</P>
<P>
Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio
Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year
contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Shabab.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
All the goals were brilliantly executed by a team who scored four goals each in
previous home encounters against USM of Gabon and Union Douala of Cameroon
having received a first round bye.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable 30-metre shot past
goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh, Milex volleyed a loose ball into the net from close
range and Saul clinically sidefooted home a cross.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Football: Injury forces Henry out of France friendlies
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has been ruled out of France's forthcoming
friendly matches against Nigeria and Turkey due to a knee injury, France coach
Raymond Domenech revealed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France have not yet decided to call up any replacements for the home games
against Nigeria on June 2 and Turkey three days later.
</P>
<P>
Henry, 31, played in Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the
Champions League final in Rome on Wednesday, having overcome a knee ligament
injury sustained in the Spanish champions' 6-2 thrashing of Real Madrid on May
2.
</P>
<P>
"I expected it a little bit," Domenech said on the French Football Federation
website on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense, Thierry didn't play for three weeks. He had to force himself to
play in the Champions League final. I understand that, I would have done the
same, anyone would have done the same, he didn't play at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that he recovers. It would achieve nothing for him
(to play against Nigeria and Turkey).
</P>
<P>
"I anticipated it. If we have 25 players in the squad, it's to manage the
situation. It was completely expected."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Wednesday's game in Rome, Henry conceded that he had been forced
to play through the pain barrier.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't think I'd play, but on Tuesday evening I started to
believe that it would be OK," the former Arsenal, Juventus and Monaco forward
said.
</P>
<P>
"With (Andres) Iniesta (who had also been an injury doubt), we gritted our
teeth."

Cycling: Menchov wins Tour of Italy despite dramatic fall
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the final stage, a 14.4km
time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist, who is the third Russian to win the race, added the title
to his two Tour of Spain victories in 2005 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old beat Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca into second at 41sec
with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers a
further 1min 18sec adrift.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18:42 with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald
Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have time to think, it all happened so quickly," Menchov said of his
tumble. "In my earpiece I heard 'no risks, no risks'.
</P>
<P>
"My first move was to get the back back up, but it was too risky. Luckily the
mechanic, in a very professional way, already had another bike there for me.
</P>
<P>
"This win on the Giro is the biggest of my career. It gives me a lot of
confidence. I know I can win the Tour (de France)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Second-placed Di Luca said he had "nothing to regret. "I attacked each time I
could, whenever it was possible".
</P>
<P>
"I can take a lot away from this race: two stage wins, seven days in the pink
jersey, and the final points jersey. It's been the greatest race of my life."
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in its centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time-check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride, but quick thinking from his mechanic may have
secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained a further 21sec on his rival.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre finished fourth and seven-time Tour winner
Lance Armstrong came in 12th.
</P>
<P>
Sastre said the race had left a "bitter-sweet taste".
</P>
<P>
"I came with an ambition different from what I achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I won two stages but I missed out on the podium. For three weeks we haven't had
a quiet stage. It's been a really tough course."

Rugby League: Huddersfield grab last gasp victory over Castleford
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on
Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14.
</P>
<P>
Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave
them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break.
</P>
<P>
But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before
Kirmond crossed to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin
Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it
6-6 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left
stunned at the death.
</P>
<P>
Huddersfield coach Nathan Brown hailed the Giants never-say-die attitude as they
sealed a semi-final clash with holders St Helens.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great result for the club but it was a frustrating performance for us at
times," said the former St George coach.
</P>
<P>
"We played poorly at times but the one thing we do is try pretty hard and
because we do that we give ourselves chances to win games at the end and
fortunately we did that this time.
</P>
<P>
"We came up with some key plays at the end and it's a real privilege to be in
the last four.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are in the last four we've got a great chance and for us to have come
this far we must be doing something right."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to
dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with
three drop goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his
fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then
National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the
last four.
</P>
<P>
The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished
24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty.
</P>
<P>
The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed
Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts.
</P>
<P>
The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson,
which saw the first-half finish all square.
</P>
<P>
Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the
Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint
Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster.
</P>
<P>
The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points
when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in
front.
</P>
<P>
A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match
into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it.
</P>
<P>
St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try
66-6 victory over Gateshead.
</P>
<P>
The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former
Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery
grabbed doubles for Saints.
</P>
<P>
Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence
with a 28-6 win over Salford.
</P>
<P>
Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of
tries and eight points with the boot.
</P>
<P>
In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century
of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6.
</P>
<P>
Wakefield ran in nine tries, with the game all but over at the break as Trinity
led by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
Trinity's tries came from Ryan Atkins, Michael Korkidas, Scott Grix, Danny
Brough and Brad Drew before the break, while Jamie Rooney went over twice,
before Steve Snitch and Drew, with his second, completed the rout.

Tennis: Safina powers on, Ivanovic heads home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals
on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the
Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai
6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four
matches.
</P>
<P>
Also through to the last eight was comeback queen Maria Sharapova who dug deep
for a fourth straight match to see off China's Li Na 6-4, 0-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
She will next go up against Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova who had too much
movement about the court and allround ability for Agnes Szavay of Hungary
winning 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she had won three titles
this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form
which almost forced her to miss her title defence.
</P>
<P>
Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the
first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it
was all but over.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage
two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve
allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little
bit more for me now," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a
big step for me.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay
this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready."
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set.
</P>
<P>
"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth
game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. It was really hard after
that."
</P>
<P>
Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on
winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that
she is a worthy world No.1.
</P>
<P>
But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck
Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg
earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina.
</P>
<P>
"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know
how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now.
</P>
<P>
"Since I became number one (April 20) I am playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season
and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Sharapova was taken the distance in her three earlier matches finding a way to
win each time, but she looked to be on the way out as her game fell apart
against Li after the Russian had won the first set.
</P>
<P>
All seemed lost for the former world No.1 after Li went a break up 4-2 in the
decider, only for Sharapova to suddenly turn on the power again and win the next
four games.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit,
dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out
into a 4-0 lead and never looking like being caught after that.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

GM: 54 percent of bondholders approve Treasury plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creditors holding about 54 percent of General's Motors bonds have approved a
restructuring plan proposed by the US Treasury, a spokesman for the bondholders
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 54 percent represented 975 institutions, a spokesman for the ad hoc
committee of bondholders, Elliot Sloane told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had given the bondholders until the end of the day Saturday to
respond to its proposal to create a new company and shed assets that were
causing losses.
</P>
<P>
The creditors collectively would receive 10 percent of GM's stock in return for
their shares, and warrants, or options to buy stock, allowing them to acquire up
to an additional 15 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
If the options are exercised, they would control up to 25 percent of the "new
GM," while the Treasury would at least initially hold a 72.5 percent stake in
the company that emerges from a bankruptcy court reorganization.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan account for about 46 percent of GM's bond
debt. They can contest it in court and try to get as much of what they are owed
as they can through the bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned that they may end up with little or nothing if they
take that route.
</P>
<P>
Once the world's biggest auto company, General Motors was poised Sunday to file
for bankruptcy protection.

Berlusconi defends right to privacy after fresh revelations
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hit out at coverage of his private life
on Sunday, dismissing reports that he hosted a party featuring topless women as
an intolerable intrusion on his privacy.
</P>
<P>
"We have really hit rock-bottom with this intrusion into the private life of
everyone," Berlusconi said at a press conference where he was asked both about
reports that his estranged wife was having an affair and about photos from a
party which are subject to a court injunction.
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the hundreds of photos taken at his Sardinia villa reportedly
featuring topless young women attending private functions in the gardens there,
Berlusconi defended his move to block their publication.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can accept that from outside his house, a photographer can manage to
take photos of the interior of his house," he said at the press conference in
the southern town of Bari.
</P>
<P>
"These pictures go against any sense of private life. This right to a private
life and to confidentiality are fundamental liberties," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Il Corriere della Sera newspapers, the pictures showed girls in
bikinis or topless wandering in the garden or standing under open-air showers.
</P>
<P>
Other girls, dressed, were pictured at Berlusconi's side.
</P>
<P>
The photos came from a New Years Eve party at the villa. The teenager at the
centre of the row between Berlusconi and wife earlier this month, which led her
to file for divorce, attended the party, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was also asked about a report in the daily newspaper Libero, in which
right-wing politician Daniela Santanche alleged that Berlusconi's wife, Veronica
Lario, had a "companion" -- naming the man in question.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi said he was annoyed to see that his family's private life was being
splashed over the front page of a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I would like not to respond," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Defending Berlusconi, Santanche said he had not wrecked anyone's family, but his
wife had had a companion for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Berlusconi had tried everything to keep his family together," said Santanche,
the leader of the small Movement for Italy party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Lario announced she wanted a divorce, saying she had run out
of patience over Berlusconi's well-known penchant for pretty women.

Pro-president party ahead in South Ossetia vote: early results
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South
Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results
showed.
</P>
<P>
The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should
allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel
region recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost 8.0 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were third with 14.6 percent of the vote. Final results were due
at 0600 GMT on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by the sidelining of the anti-Kokoity opposition amid
talk he wants a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.

Tennis: Soderling ends Nadal's French Open reign
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's four-year Roland Garros reign came to a sensational end at the
hands of feuding rival Robin Soderling on Sunday as the race for the 2009 title
was thrown wide open.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, bidding for a record fifth successive French Open crown, slumped to his
first ever defeat here after winning all of his 31 matches since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
His 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round loss was made harder to swallow
as it came against a man he described as one of the most unpopular in the locker
room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash in 2007.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories," said Nadal, who had routed
Soderling 6-1, 6-0 at the Rome Masters just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be.
I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it easy
for him."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, whose win meant that compatriot Bjorn Borg kept level on four
successive wins with Nadal, said he always thought he could prevail.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest challenge to play the best claycourt player in history," said
the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"But I had to believe I had a chance or I may as well go home. If he thinks that
he made it easy for me then that's his choice. I would never say anything like
that."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who has battled back from a serious wrist injury, sent down a massive
61 winners to Nadal's 33 as the champion, looking jaded after another marathon
claycourt season, struggled to get any meaningful foothold in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset as the 23rd seeded Soderling unleashed
a brutal power game based on big serving and pinpoint accuracy with one of the
event's most devastating forehands.
</P>
<P>
Soderling will now face Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a semi-
finalist, who completed Spain's miserable day with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 win over
eighth seed Fernando Verdasco.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final with a
convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old Murray looked in impressive physical condition
with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded
Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well." said Murray, only the third British man to make the last
eight here in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
"You don't reach the French Open quarter-finals without playing well.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good claycourt season. I reached the quarters in Monte Carlo and
Madrid and now the last eight here. It's better than previous years but I will
try to keep on improving."
</P>
<P>
Murray next meets Chilean 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez who revealed how an injury
signing autographs almost shattered his French Open campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos
and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."

Hundreds cheer Dalai Lama as he leaves Denmark

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dalai Lama left Copenhagen on Sunday under the cheers of an adoring throng
of hundreds bidding farewell to Tibet's spiritual leader, whose latest trip to
Europe has angered China again.
</P>
<P>
He shook the hands of supporters who had waited for him outside his hotel as he
headed to the airport to travel to Iceland, the second leg of a trip that will
also take him to the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
"As usual my visit to Denmark and to other countries is mainly spiritual and
educational, not political," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
China criticised the Dalai Lama's meeting with Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen and other top Danish elected officials, saying it "severely harmed"
relations between China and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also been angered by the decision by Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe to
meet the Buddhist monk and give him an honorary citizen award when he visits
France June 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama told AFP that he felt "a great honour" to be receiving the award.
</P>
<P>
Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking independence for Tibet from Chinese
rule and considers any official meeting with the leader as meddling in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet after the
failure of an anti-Chinese uprising in 1949, says he just wants meaningful
autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

Tennis: Defeat not tragedy as Nadal vows to bounce back
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dethroned French Open champion Rafael Nadal vowed to bounce back from his
stunning loss to Robin Soderling, which shattered his dreams of a record fifth
successive Roland Garros title.
</P>
<P>
The world number one insisted he'd be better and stronger in time for his
Wimbledon title defence in three weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of the road and I have to accept it," said the world number one,
who was beaten for the first time at Roland Garros following 31 wins in 31
matches since his 2005 debut which propelled him to super-stardom.
</P>
<P>
"I have to accept my defeat as I accept my victories - with calm. I have to keep
a cool head to try and analyze what I did wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I need to learn, and you learn more when you lose than when you win. I need to
work on those points on which I wasn't good, and from there try and do better
for my next tournament.
</P>
<P>
"So this is not a tragedy, losing here in Paris. It had to happen one day."
</P>
<P>
For Nadal, losing his proud record could not have come at the hands of the worst
possible opponent after he and Soderling, who are not on speaking terms, fell
out after an acrimonious Wimbledon defeat in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was irritated by the big Swede's on-court imitation of his habit of
pulling at the rear of his shorts while Soderling dismissed the criticisms as
"bullshit".
</P>
<P>
Nadal, who turns 23 on Wednesday, said he would not get too downcast about his
fourth round 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) defeat.
</P>
<P>
The first thing he will do is head to the swimming pool at his Mallorca home and
convince himself that one defeat has not suddenly made him a bad player
following a 12 months where he won Wimbledon, the Olympics and the Australian
Open.
</P>
<P>
"This is sport, and you can have victories or defeats. No one remembers defeats
in the long run. People remember victories," added the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
"So I have to move forward. I have a little time to prepare for Wimbledon, but I
have to move forward and try and prepare the best I can."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who had never got beyond the third round of a Grand Slam before this
French Open, insists his feud with Nadal is a thing of the past, but he simply
refused to be intimidated by the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
"He's just another player on the tour. He's the best claycourt player of all
time, but he's just like someone else to me," said the Swede who goes on to
tackle two-time semi-finalist Nikolay Davydenko for a place in the last four.
</P>
<P>
Soderling believes that the time he spent out of action at the end of 2007 and
the start of 2008, nursing a wrist injury, may have proved a crucial part in his
victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit lucky because it was my left wrist. I was off the tour for
maybe five or six months, but I practiced a lot of tennis," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"I practiced my slice and my forehand. I couldn't do anything except for my two
handed backhand. I used the time very well.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of just waiting for the wrist to heal, I did everything I could.  I was
working out three, four hours in the gym every day."
</P>
<P>
Soderling also paid tribute to compatriot and coach Magnus Norman who made the
2000 final here.
</P>
<P>
"He definitely helped me a lot. He was a great player. What I like is that I can
really ask him anything - 'Did you feel the same when you were playing?', 'How
did you feel?' I think that is really helping me."

Four killed in Yemen clashes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Sanaa, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Yemenis, including a policeman, were killed and 13 others wounded in two
days of clashes between police and anti-government protesters in southern Yemen,
medics and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The deaths bring the toll of Yemenis killed since demonstrations broke out in
the south in late April to 16, including five security force members. The Sanaa
government has blamed the protests on southern separatists.
</P>
<P>
A policeman and a demonstrator were killed on Sunday in the village of Labouss
in the southern province of Lahij, while another demonstrator was wounded in
confrontations in the nearby village of al-Eind, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters chanted slogans against the government, which is controlled by
northerners, and carried posters of Ali Nasser Mohammed, the former president of
South Yemen, which was united with North Yemen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, one Yemeni protester was killed and five others wounded in
clashes when police opened fire to disperse a demonstration in Dali, north of
the southern port of Aden, capital of the former South Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. He was
hit by a bullet," medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators carrying banners with
anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out again at the hospital as police tried to arrest a wounded
demonstrator, resulting in injuries to a policeman and a protester, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in Dali was in its second day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, one protester was killed and five others wounded in a clash with
police in the village of Ashehir, in the southeastern region of Hadramawt,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance was triggered by demands to release locals arrested over earlier
protests against the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Socialists who formerly ruled the south led a secession bid in 1994 that sparked
a two-month civil war before the uprising was crushed by northern forces loyal
to veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The president has warned against the risks of Yemen breaking up into "several
entities" amid trouble in the south over the past year, sparked by social
demands and charges of negligence in the impoverished state.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, speaking on Sunday during a visit to Riyadh, thanked northern neighbour
Saudi Arabia for its support for Yemeni unity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement reported by Saudi official news agency SPA, Saleh praised King
Abdullah for "his support for Yemen, its security, its stability and its unity
as well as his strong backing of Yemen's development efforts."
</P>
<P>
"A strong, safe and stable Yemen is in the interest of the Saudi kingdom" and
the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC also comprises Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and
Qatar.

Cycling: Giro result 'promising' for Tour de France, says Armstrong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said his 12th-placed finish in
the Giro d'Italia, which ended on Sunday, was "promising" ahead of this year's
French test.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old American, who broke a collarbone in a crash on the Tour of
Castilla and Leon in March, and his Astana team had insisted that he had not
come into his first ever Tour of Italy looking for victory.
</P>
<P>
"I came in open-minded. I did not know what to expect, obviously because of the
crash in Castilla and Leon, the time off the bike and the trip over here,"
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
"In my view it has been a hard three weeks. In the second half of the race I
showed that I was certainly getting better and I think we can take that away
from here. It is promising for June and July."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong dismissed expectations that he would have returned to the cycling
world with victories in the biggest events.
</P>
<P>
"I may have disappointed some fans and people in the press room expecting that I
immediately should start winning big races," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is crazy. I am almost 38 years old. Both of my feet are firmly on the
ground. It's taken a lot of work up to this point but we might ride strong and
be in the front in July."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong added: "The style of racing in Italy is different, but I liked it.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some dangerous stages, it was a great race. The Giro del Centenario
brought us to the most beautiful places of the country. The people here are
enthusiastic."
</P>
<P>
Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel said he hoped the matter of some unpaid
salaries would be resolved so the team could go on and compete in the Tour of
Luxembourg, the Dauphine Libere, the Tour of Switzerland and the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful and confident that we can ride those races," said Bruyneel. The
financial woes that left salaries unpaid are not completely resolved yet.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the team sponsors will meet the deadline for the bank guarantee and
the payments.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover the UCI (International Cycling Union) now wants more guarantees about
the team for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The UCI will decide soon about the near future of the team. We hope to know
more in the coming days. The best solution is that we can continue with our
current structure. I expect that we will have a team at the start of the Tour de
France."

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio
Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year
contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Shabab.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
All the goals were brilliantly executed by a team who scored four goals each in
previous home encounters against USM of Gabon and Union Douala of Cameroon
having received a first round bye.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable 30-metre shot past
goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh, Milex volleyed a loose ball into the net from close
range and Saul clinically sidefooted home a cross.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial provider of late-term abortions was shot to death Sunday as he
walked into services at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A lightning rod in the bitter culture war over abortion, George Tiller had
already been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms.
</P>
<P>
He was shot to death just after 10 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of Reformation
Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
A white man wielding a handgun shot Tiller, 67, and then fled in a powder blue
Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These things should not occur at a any time."
</P>
<P>
The FBI and state police were called in to help search for the shooter, whose
license plate was registered to a home in a suburb of Kansas City, some 200
miles away on the border with Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The shooting came just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common
ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of
the top Catholic universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested
outside his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of
federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in
1994 that listed Tiller as the top target.
</P>
<P>
Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United
States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that
would be viable outside the mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
Tiller was acquitted of having an illegal financial relationship with the doctor
who provided the second opinion.

GM poised for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury put the final touches Sunday on a plan to restructure General
Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join rival
Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry. GM's new chief
executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news conference for the middle of
the day in New York, where the number one US automaker would file for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Barack Obama has given GM until June 1 to
present a viable restructuring plan, in return for government aid.
</P>
<P>
The rescue could reach 60 billion dollars with the state taking a 72.5 per cent
ownership stake in the 101 year old company. Canada, which has several GM
factories, also will be digging into its pockets.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times, holders of GM's secured bonds agreed by a small
majority on Saturday to a new Treasury rescue plan that would give them 25
percent of the company. Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected,
creditors risked losing everything.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
The New York bankruptcy court also is expected to rule Monday on number three US
automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, judge Arthur Gonzales was expected to approve the
creation of a new Chrysler, called 'New Carco,' which would preserve the
automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big
mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler
out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Cycling: Menchov wins Tour of Italy despite dramatic fall
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the final stage, a 14.4km
time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist, who is the third Russian to win the race, added the title
to his two Tour of Spain victories in 2005 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old beat Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca into second at 41sec
with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers a
further 1min 18sec adrift.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18:42 with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald
Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to regret," said Di Luca. "I attacked each time I could,
whenever it was possible.
</P>
<P>
"I can take a lot away from this race: two stage wins, seven days in the pink
jersey, and the final points jersey. It's been the greatest race of my life."
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in its centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time-check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride, but quick thinking from his mechanic may have
secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained a further 21sec on his rival.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre finished fourth and seven-time Tour winner
Lance Armstrong came in 12th.
</P>
<P>
Sastre said the race had left a "bitter-sweet taste".
</P>
<P>
"I came with an ambition different from what I achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I won two stages but I missed out on the podium. For three weeks we haven't had
a quiet stage. It's been a really tough course."

Yemen to inaugurate first LNG plant
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANAA, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yemen will inaugurate its first liquefied natural gas plant next month and begin
exporting in August with the first shipment destined for South Korea, the oil
minister said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plant at Balhaf on the south coast is ready "for its official inauguration
on June 16, and the export of its first shipment of gas to South Korea will come
eight weeks later," Oil Minister Amir Salem al-Aydarus said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Korea, LNG from Yemen will also be exported to Europe and
north America, the minister said in a statement posted online on the defence
ministry's website, 26Sep.net.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has already taken delivery of two of four LNG tankers on order, the
statement said, quoting Aydarus as saying the remaining two ships will be
delivered "in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
A tanker carrying the first shipment of 120,000 cubic metres (more than four
million cubic feet) of LNG will sail for South Korea in August.
</P>
<P>
The maiden cargo of gas will mark the culmination of a project launched in
October 2005 at a total cost of four billion dollars, making it the largest ever
project in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The LNG project is vital to the economic future of Yemen, where oil revenues
currently make up 70 percent of state revenue.
</P>
<P>
When a second liquefying unit becomes operational towards the end of the year
Yemen will be able to export 6.7 million tonnes of gas annually -- equivalent to
180,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
It will remain a small player on the LNG market nevertheless, with reserves of
259 billion cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the poorest countries on Earth despite its proximity to oil
powerhouse Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Its own oil exports are tiny compared with its northern neighbour. Last year it
produced less than 300,000 bpd of crude oil, and production is decreasing by
five to six percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Abdulkarim Ismail al-Arhabi told AFP
in March that he expects the country's modest oil reserves to be exhausted by
2020.
</P>
<P>
"Gas will make up for the decrease in oil production," he said.

Rafael Nadal's four-year Roland Garros reign came to a sensational end at the

was thrown wide open.
</P>

Nadal, bidding for a record fifth successive French Open crown, slumped to his
first ever defeat here after winning all of his 31 matches since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
His 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round loss was made harder to swallow
as it came against a man he described as one of the most unpopular in the locker
room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash in 2007.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories," said Nadal, who had routed
Soderling 6-1, 6-0 at the Rome Masters just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be.
I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it easy
for him to play at his level."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, whose win meant that compatriot Bjorn Borg kept level on four
successive wins with Nadal, said he always thought he could win.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest challenge to play the best claycourt player in history," said
the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"But I had to believe I had a chance or I may as well go home. But if he thinks
that he made it easy for me then that's his choice. I would never say anything
like that."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who has battled back from a serious wrist injury, sent down a massive
61 winners to Nadal's 33 as the champion, looking jaded after another marathon
claycourt season, struggled to get any meaningful foothold in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset as the 23rd seeded Soderling unleashed
a brutal power game based on big serving and pinpoint accuracy with one of the
event's most devastating forehands.
</P>
<P>
The Swede's sensational victory, which will now boost Roger Federer's lifetime
dream of adding an elusive French Open to his 13-title Grand Slam collection,
overshadowed Sunday's three other last 16 ties.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final with a
convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old Murray looked in impressive physical condition
with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded
Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well." said Murray, only the third British man to make the last
eight here in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
"You don't reach the French Open quarter-finals without playing well.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good claycourt season. I reached the quarters in Monte Carlo and
Madrid and now the last eight here. It's better than previous years but I will
try to keep on improving."
</P>
<P>
Murray next meets Chilean 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez who revealed how an injury
signing autographs almost shattered his French Open campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos
and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."
</P>
<P>
In the day's other last 16 tie, Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a
semi-finalist, faces Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco who is looking for a
first quarter-final place.
</P>
<P>
The winner will tackle Soderling for a place in the semi-finals.

Britain to fight lawsuit from US shock-jock
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British government said Sunday it would fight any legal action brought by
right-wing US radio host Michael Savage after he was barred from entering the
country for "unacceptable behaviour".
</P>
<P>
Savage has threatened to sue Home Secretary Jacqui Smith for defamation after he
was named on a list she announced this month of 16 banned individuals, which
included a Hamas lawmaker, anti-gay protesters and a Jewish extremist.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday reported that Savage, whose real name is Michael Alan Weiner,
was planning to sue for 100,000 pounds (160,000 dollars, 115,000 euros) and had
instructed London-based solicitors Olswang to begin proceedings.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the lawyers have written to Smith and demanded she
retract the allegations and make a personal apology.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Home Office said it would not back down.
</P>
<P>
"He was excluded for engaging in unacceptable behaviour by making comments that
might provoke others to serious criminal acts and foster hatred that might lead
to inter-community violence," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Any legal proceedings would be robustly defended; we stand by our decision to
exclude this individual.
</P>
<P>
"Coming to the UK is a privilege that we refuse to extend to those who abuse our
standards and values to undermine our way of life."
</P>
<P>
Savage has been accused of racism and homophobia and once wished that a critical
caller would die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, an appeal for donations to support his legal challenge posted on his
website insists he has never advocated violence.
</P>
<P>
"He has repeatedly called for the lawful enforcement of America’s borders,
language, and culture. He has never advocated violence, or he would not have
lasted in radio for 15 minutes, let alone 15 years," the appeal says.

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Johannesburg, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Nigeria troops destroy militant camp: spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAGOS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigeria's army said Sunday it had destroyed a militants' camp in southern Rivers
state as part of their campaign to put a halt to a campaign of unrest and
hostage-takings in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of Joint Task Force (JTF) have located and destroyed a militants'
camp close to Buguma creek in Rivers State after a fierce exchange of fire with
the militants," army spokesman Rabe Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of JTF were fired at from the militants’ camp over night and the
security outfit has no choice but to locate and destroy the camp," he said in an
e-mail to AFP.
</P>
<P>
He said the military would get "rid of the criminals who are bent on causing
unnecessary tension and apprehension in the region".
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the military also recovered some arms and ammunition during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
Several camps operated by militants have been destroyed since May 13 when
federal troops launched their operation against fighters of the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND).
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half years MEND, which says it is fighting to ensure
local people have a greater share in the oil wealth, has been behind a series of
kidnappings of staff and attacks on oil installations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the Niger Delta has reduced Nigeria's daily output to 1.76 million
barrels compared with 2.6 million barrels in January 2006.

Armenia opposition pins hopes on Yerevan poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YEREVAN, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Armenian capital voted in a municipal election Sunday in which
the main opposition movement is seeking to gain an important foothold on power
after losing political ground last year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Congress is hoping it can win enough seats on the 65-seat
Yerevan city council for its leader -- former president Levon Ter-Petrosian --
to be elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
The vote has raised fears of a repeat of the violence after last year's
presidential elections that saw 10 people killed in clashes between riot police
and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian and his backers accused the authorities of rigging the vote to
guarantee a win for President Serzh Sarkisian, who defeated Ter-Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it is likely the opposition will hold protests if it loses again,
risking another confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal elections are the first stage of ridding the country of this
criminal regime," said 29-year-old voter Astkhik Petrosian. "I voted for the
opposition. Once they have taken power in the city we will be able to have new
early presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 8:00 am (0400 GMT) and closed 12 hours later, with final voter
turnout at about 53 percent, the Central Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are to be announced within 24 hours after the vote and the
final results during the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
The city council will chose the mayor under constitutional amendments adopted in
2005. Armenia's president previously made the appointment for the four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
If any party wins 40 percent of the seats, its candidate becomes the city mayor,
otherwise the mayor is to be elected by the city council.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan's current mayor, Gagik Beglarian, is topping the ruling Republican
party's list in the municipal vote and opinion polls showed him leading.
</P>
<P>
"Beglarian has done a lot as mayor. It is easy to see that the city has become
more beautiful and orderly, that the city has changed for the better. So I voted
for the Republican party," said 43-year-old voter Sarkis.
</P>
<P>
Beglarian told journalists Sunday the vote was proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"No violations have been observed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian's party, however, said its activists had observed dozens of
violations on voting day, including voting by non-residents of the capital,
multiple ballot-casting and intimidation of opposition journalists.
</P>
<P>
The international community will be watching the vote to see if Armenia is
keeping its commitments on democratic reforms. An observers' delegation,
including Council of Europe and European Union representatives, is to make a
statement on the conduct of the vote Monday.

Mauritania coup chief campaigns as talks mull vote delay
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NOUAKCHOTT, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of last year's coup in Mauritania began a final push for votes Sunday
in the week before scheduled elections as his aides took part in talks about a
possible delay to the polls.
</P>
<P>
On a trip to the north, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pledged to improve
living standards in the poverty-stricken nation if he returns to power after the
scheduled June 6 ballot which he is widely expected to win.
</P>
<P>
But with the main opposition dismissing next weekend's polls as little more than
a sham, much of the attention was focused on neighbouring Senegal where
international mediators are convening talks aimed at resolving the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
According to the state news agency, Aziz pledged during a campaign apperarance
in the northern Atar region to work to bring about "an improvement in living
standards for every citizen, in particular the most vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
Aziz also promised to upgrade facilities in all the country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
But while Aziz denounced talk of a delay in the polls over the weekend as
"rumours and lies", a source close to the opposition said that the talks in
Dakar were focusing on a proposal to delay the first round of the elections
until July 21 with the second round taking place on August 4.
</P>
<P>
A draft accord being discussed in the Senegalese capital Dakar would also see
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was toppled in last August's coup, formally resign as
president after signing a decree to usher in a transitional period under a
temporary government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks began in Dakar last Thursday and resumed on Sunday morning
with Senegal's Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio saying he was convinced
that the talks would end with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamara, the United
Nations special representative for West Africa Said Djinnit and the US and
French ambassadors to Senegal are also participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz initially took power in the northwest African nation in August
last year as head of a military junta which toppled Cheikh Abdallahi, the
country's first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
He then quit the military in April to run for president in a move widely seen as
a ploy to legitimise the coup. The former junta chief is running against only
three other marginal candidates who have all supported the coup.

Cricket: Smith looks to cap Test success with T20 triumph
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes winning the ICC World Twenty20 in
England will be the ideal way to show his side are a force to be reckoned with
in all forms of the game.
</P>
<P>
Smith has led his side to Test series wins in England and Australia in recent
times and now the opening batsman is looking for fresh success on English soil
as South Africa seek a first major one-day trophy since 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It would be lovely if we could be successful in this tournament or any ICC
tournament that is coming up," Smith told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have had an incredible period in the last 16 months and the team has
achieved so much.
</P>
<P>
"The confidence is good and we are excited about playing this tournament with
the chance to go out and express ourselves. I think there is a lot more talent,
flair and confidence among this team than ever before."
</P>
<P>
Smith and several of his compatriots had the ideal preparation for the World
Twenty20 by taking part in the 20-overs-per-side Indian Premier League.
</P>
<P>
A franchise event featuring many of the world's leading players, the IPL was
moved to South Africa at short notice after security fears meant it could not be
played in India.
</P>
<P>
"Cricket South Africa and the country as a whole did a fantastic job in hosting
the event at three weeks' notice," said Smith.
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible effort and we proved our country’s ability at hosting
major events. A lot of our players had prominent roles in a number of the teams
which probably wouldn’t have happened if it had been in India and they had
good leadership roles among their teams."
</P>
<P>
Veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis helped the Bangalore Royal Challengers to the
IPL final.
</P>
<P>
He has, though, sometimes been criticised for slow scoring and an unwillingness
to bowl his sharp seamers and Smith said: "Jacques is the one player who arrives
here with a point to prove.
</P>
<P>
"He had a decent performance in the IPL so his confidence his high and
tactically how we use him is important. He’s an all-rounder and needs to
contribute in all forms."
</P>
<P>
For many South African players, the combination of international and IPL
commitments has led to a fairly intense schedule.
</P>
<P>
"Mental fatigue is probably our biggest challenge and something we have
addressed as a team," Smith, whose side are in Group D alongside New Zealand and
minnows Scotland, said.
</P>
<P>
That professionalism wasn't matched, in Smith's eyes, on Sunday when the Proteas
turned up at the Southgate club ground in north London, used by Middlesex for
home matches when they are not at Lord's, for a practice session only to
discover that their arrival was news to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
They had to head back to Lord's instead and Smith said: "Even today with the
not-so-great training facilities we have had all over the place the guys have
still applied themselves."

<TEXT>
<P>
Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain Raul
Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol fans probably thought they would be struggling to fill their new
Cornella-El Prat stadium in the second division but the club produced a
sensational late run to beat the drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games gone Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from safety,
but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and an incredible
run saw the club win eight out of the final ten games.
</P>
<P>
Promoted Malaga, reduced to ten men after the sending off of Weligton on 54
minutes, finish a respectable eighth and can be proud of a season when they
knocked on Europe's door, briefly flirting with the Champions League spots.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other early match Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game
with little at stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League with third place and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of their
campaign the memories of beating treble winners Barcelona 1-0 in Soria on the
opening day of the season.
</P>
<P>
Later on Sunday five teams fight to stay in the division in a tense relegation
finale.
</P>
<P>
Numancia and Recreativo Huelva are already down leaving one unwanted spot left
to fill.
</P>
<P>
Osasuna currently occupy third from bottom and must defeat Real Madrid, who have
lost their last four games, in Pamplona to guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
Sporting Gijon are level on 40 points with Osasuna and face already relegated
Recreativo at home.
</P>
<P>
Real Betis, a point above the drop, host a freefalling Valladolid in Sevilla
with both teams capable of going down.
</P>
<P>
Getafe, level on points with Betis, are at Racing Santander needing a win to
ensure their survival.

Football: Milan give Maldini and Ancelotti perfect send-off

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo
Maldini and Carlo Ancelotti a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and
having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but
goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
That was immediately followed by Ancelotti announcing he was leaving the club,
who then replaced him with technical director Leonardo, a former player and
World Cup winner with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two
qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home
win over Lazio.
</P>
<P>
But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in
Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti
avoided that by making his announcement to Sky Sport TV cameras after the match.
</P>
<P>
He claimed it was a mutual decision taken with club vice-president Adriano
Galliani, although he refused to confirm he would be joining Chelsea next
season.
</P>
<P>
"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end. Our paths are
separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate
the contract," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual. London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who had to win to take a top three finish, started brightly and
former Milan forward Alberto Gilardino got on the end of a left-wing cross on
22-minutes but headed wide under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a
vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli
appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way.
</P>
<P>
On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the
post with the outside of his right boot.
</P>
<P>
But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo
released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by
Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball.
</P>
<P>
Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the
bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat.
</P>
<P>
However substitute Pato did seal the victory on 76 minutes as he beat the
offside trap and then chipped Frey as the Frenchman went to ground.
</P>
<P>
Champions Inter Milan came back from 3-2 down to beat Atalanta 4-3 at the San
Siro as Portugal veteran Luis Figo also bowed out from the game.
</P>
<P>
Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimvoic also took the golden boot award after his two
goals took his tally to 25 this season.
</P>
<P>
"You can't do better than that, I'm very happy. I worked really hard for this,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"When  arrived in Italy people said I was a great player but didn't score many
goals."
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimovic refused to commit his future to Inter despite speculation
surrounding a possible move to Spain, however coach Jose Mourinho insisted his
man would stay.
</P>
<P>
"I continue to think that next year Ibra will still be an Inter player," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Czech veteran Pavel Nedved was another player departing as he played his final
game for Juventus, with two Vincenzo Iaquinta goals securing their victory.
</P>
<P>
Torino joined Reggina and Lecce in being relegated to Serie B after they lost
3-2 at AS Roma and Bologna won 3-1 at home to Catania.

French physicists claim breakthrough in ultra-fast data access
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could
accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times,
pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry.
</P>
<P>
The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for
Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a
revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a
large electric output.
</P>
<P>
These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that
scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored.
</P>
<P>
That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses
not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to
provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the
relative slowness of magnetic sensors.
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by
Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in
Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser
light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage.
</P>
<P>
"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of
light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage
surface, Bigot told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a
second, said Bigot.
</P>
<P>
Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10
centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics,
he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research,
Bigot said.

First genes spotted for testicular cancer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are
associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between
the ages of 15 and 45.
</P>
<P>
Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk
of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730
men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men.
</P>
<P>
Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called
testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold.
</P>
<P>
The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had
testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been
searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth
Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of
Surrey.
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working
on identifying the rest."
</P>
<P>
The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are
precursors in sperm development.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the
rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Why this is so is unclear. Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and
seems to be far higher than for other cancer types.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is
eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of
patients, the risk is four to six times higher.
</P>
<P>
Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR
said.

Football: Perez could take charge again of Real on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 26, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Real Madrid president Florentino Perez could automatically take charge
again of Spain's historically most successful team on Monday if no other
candidate throws in his hat to run for president by a deadline of midnight on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old, who led Real from 2000 to 2006, was the only candidate for the
post after former club vice-president Juan Onieva withdrew his candidacy last
week, saying his proposed programme had not been well received.
</P>
<P>
Under Perez, Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera Liga
twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is
back" and said the team he would help to build would be world beaters.
</P>
<P>
"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. We have set up a
strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers
who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has
reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become
coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian
playmaker Kaka.
</P>
<P>
"I do not place any limit on myself," he said in an interview published Sunday
in top-selling daily newspaper El Pais, adding the club "needs a revolution".
</P>
<P>
Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the Spanish Cup in a
superb season under debutant coach Pep Guardiola that left Real looking ordinary
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
But Perez said the success of Real's arch-rivals this season "motivates me even
more".
</P>
<P>
If there is more than one candidate for president, a vote will be held on June
14.
</P>
<P>
While the club normally holds elections every four years, it faces the prospect
of holding a ballot a year early due to the resignation of former president
Ramon Calderon in January.
</P>
<P>
That followed allegations he rigged voting at the club's last general assembly
in December, which approved its financial accounts.
</P>
<P>
Calderon has been replaced on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda.

Tennis: Nadal five-title dream crushed by Soderling sledgehammer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament, the Spanish king
of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31
outings since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round victory came
just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome
Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was a man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be,"
said Nadal who had won the Monte Carlo, Rome and Barcelona events in the run-up
to Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it
easy for him to play at his level. But I lost.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories."
</P>
<P>
Soderling was in tears by the end.
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said the Swede who has
never gone this far before in a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of myself. This is the best win of my career against a man who is
the greatest claycourt player in history."
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to
the Spaniard's 33.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Football: Milan promote Leonardo as Ancelotti exits
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and
Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director.
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti told Italian Sky Sport TV of his departure following the 2-0 win at
Fiorentina that ensured the seven-time European champions finished third and
avoided having to play two qualifying rounds to reach next season's Champions
League group stages.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was announcing his
replacement on Rai TV.
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had
become the worst-kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure,
but he refused to confirm that English side Chelsea would be his destination.
</P>
<P>
"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end," said a visibly
emotional Ancelotti.
</P>
<P>
"Our paths are separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided
to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual. London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World
Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but has received heavy criticism in the
last two years for failing to mount a serious challenge to champions Inter
Milan.
</P>
<P>
But he will remain a legend at the club where he also won two European Cups as a
player, thus becoming one of the few people in history to claim Europe's premier
competition as both player and coach.
</P>
<P>
He also played for Parma and Roma and coached Reggiana, Parma and Juventus
before joining Milan in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Galliani told Rai: "Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. He will be
officially presented tomorrow (Monday) at midday.
</P>
<P>
"With Ancelotti the story is not finished. We will stay friends, we had eight
marvellous years together.
</P>
<P>
"Carlo and I are very good friends and there were a few tears in the changing
rooms."
</P>
<P>
Leonardo had long been tipped to take over from Ancelotti, with Friday's
Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that it was a done deal.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former midfielder and left-back played for the club from
1997-2001, winning the league title in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994,
although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off
against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game
suspension that saw him miss the final.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has
proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his debut season
in charge of the Catalans.

Motorcycling: Stoner ends Rossi's seven year reign at Mugello
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SCARPERIA, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand
Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here.
</P>
<P>
The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race
of the season.
</P>
<P>
He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the
championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>
<P>
"Once I got onto the slicks I found a good feeling immediately and I was able to
get to the front quite quickly, but then I started having a problem with the
clutch," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a really hard race and I just wanted to finish it. I just tried to stay
smooth and keep the same lap times even if I couldn’t ride the way I wanted
to."
</P>
<P>
He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.
</P>
<P>
Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for
the harder compound.
</P>
<P>
"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. The race was really
difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. The choice of hards
was made even though I wanted the soft ones."
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap
and skidded at the start.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can't really believe the race
today, it was like a movie," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today,
so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. I'm really happy with
this result."
</P>
<P>
Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a
second.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and
immediately dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and
Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long
straight at the beginning of the second lap.
</P>
<P>
Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi
started to move up from fifth.
</P>
<P>
However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was
clearly fastest in the wet.
</P>
<P>
Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh
lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change
of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace.
</P>
<P>
Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and
35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with
Stoner and Dovizioso.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth
and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits
essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass
Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was
over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best
finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the
pits to change his bike.
</P>
<P>
It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track
for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into
their new tyres.

<P>
Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on
Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14.
</P>
<P>
Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts.
</P>

Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave
them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break.
</P>

But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before
Kirmond crossed to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin
Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it
6-6 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left
stunned at the death.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to
dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with
three drop goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his
fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then
National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the
last four.
</P>
<P>
The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished
24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty.
</P>
<P>
The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed
Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts.
</P>
<P>
The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson,
which saw the first-half finish all square.
</P>
<P>
Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the
Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint
Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster.
</P>
<P>
The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points
when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in
front.
</P>
<P>
A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match
into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it.
</P>
<P>
St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try
66-6 victory over Gateshead.
</P>
<P>
The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former
Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery
grabbed doubles for Saints.
</P>
<P>
Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence
with a 28-6 win over Salford.
</P>
<P>
Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of
tries and eight points with the boot.
</P>
<P>
In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century
of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6.
</P>
<P>
Wakefield ran in nine tries, with the game all but over at the break as Trinity
led by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
Trinity's tries came from Ryan Atkins, Michael Korkidas, Scott Grix, Danny
Brough and Brad Drew before the break, while Jamie Rooney went over twice,
before Steve Snitch and Drew, with his second, completed the rout.

Israel names new negotiator for Hamas prisoner swap
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday appointed a new envoy to
head indirect negotiations on a prisoner swap with the Islamist Hamas rulers of
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Hagai Hadas, a former commander in the Mossad spy agency, will oversee talks on
the release of soldier Gilad Shalit, held in Gaza since his capture by
Palestinian militants in June 2006, the premier's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Israel blame each other for the failure of negotiations in Cairo in
mid-March aimed at securing a deal under which Israel would free hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit.
</P>
<P>
Ofer Dekel, the previous Israeli prisoner negotiator who was appointed by former
prime minister Ehud Olmert, stepped down shortly after Netanyahu took office in
March.
</P>
<P>
The talks on a swap have not resumed since Netanyahu's right-leaning government
took office at the start of April, and the premier has so far refused to say
whether he accepts the framework of the previous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which launched a devastating 22-day onslaught on Hamas in Gaza in
December, has made the release of Shalit a precondition for a lasting ceasefire
and an end to its blockade of the enclave.
</P>
<P>
A corporal at the time of his capture, Shalit has since been promoted to staff
sergeant.

Tennis: Safina powers on, Ivanovic heads home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals
on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the
Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai
6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four
matches.
</P>
<P>
Also through and into her first Grand Slam quarter-final was Slovakia's Dominika
Cibulkova who had too much movement about the court and allround ability for
Agnes Szavay of Hungary winning 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
She will play the winner of the day's remaining fourth round tie between former
world No 1 Maria Sharpova of Russia and Li Na who is bidding to become the first
Chinese player to reach the last eight at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she has won three titles
this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form.
</P>
<P>
Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the
first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it
was all but over.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage
two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve
allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little
bit more for me now," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a
big step for me.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay
this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready."
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set.
</P>
<P>
"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth
game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. It was really hard after
that."
</P>
<P>
Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on
winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that
she is a worthy world No.1.
</P>
<P>
But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck
Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg
earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina.
</P>
<P>
"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know
how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now.
</P>
<P>
"Since I became number one I am playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season
and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit,
dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out
into a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship
in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova
taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova wiped out an early break against her in the second set as she won five
games in a row but failed to convert a match point in the following game and had
to wait till her next service game to wrap things up.
</P>
<P>
She will next go up against the winner of the tie between Sharapova and Li
knowing that she has already taken a step up the career ladder at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Wichita, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial provider of late-term abortions was shot to death Sunday as he
walked into services at his Kansas church, local media reports.
</P>
<P>
A lightning rod in the bitter culture war over abortion, George Tiller has been
picketed, bombed and shot in the arms.
</P>
<P>
He was shot to death just after 10 am (1500 GMT) as he walked into Reformation
Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, the Wichita Eagle reported.
</P>
<P>
Police contacted by AFP could not immediately confirm the report but said
details of an incident at the church would be released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, 67, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protest
outside his clinic, located just off a busy highway that runs through Wichita.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003.

Six die in shootout between Fatah and Hamas - New offer

QALQILIYA, West Bank

Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to
arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two
main Palestinian factions. The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip
warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a
"red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation.
The firefight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest
Mohammed al-Samman, commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank,
who was also on Israel's wanted list.

Football: AC Milan replace Ancelotti with Leonardo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and
Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While Ancelotti was telling Italian Sky Sport TV that he was leaving, Galliani
was announcing his replacement to Rai.
</P>
<P>
"Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. He will be officially presented tomorrow
(Monday) at midday," he told them, confirming a claim made in Friday's Gazzetta
dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old played for the club from 1997-2001, winning the league title in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994,
although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off
against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game
suspension that saw him miss the final.
</P>

Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has
proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his season in
charge of the Catalans.

Zimbabwe PM's party bemoans pace of change
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARARE, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in
Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and
attorney general to quit immediately.
</P>
<P>
In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic
Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the
unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief
Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take
the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls
that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith,"
the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also
Zimbabwe's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power-
sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is
unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its
supporters by pro-Mugabe militias.
</P>
<P>
The party said the government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow
implementation of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the
military in villages and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the
government payroll."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister sought to reassure his supporters at the end of the
conference saying he had not abandoned the party's objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The transitional government, which is a coalition government is a stepping
stone to a new and democratic Zimbabwe," he said but expressing disappoitment at
delays in implementing the coalition agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed at the pace of the implementation of some of the issues in
the global political agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The party's agenda must not be diluted by the government's agenda. We must also
acknowledge that in a marriage like this there are likely to be compromises but
we must not demobilise saying 'we have arrived.' We must continue to streng our
party structures in preparations for elections."
</P>
<P>
The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely
criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into
world record inflation.
</P>
<P>
Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in
the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a
run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's
followers.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of
political violence.
</P>
<P>
"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference
resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the
welfare of victims," the party said.

Carlo Ancelotti announced he was quitting AC Milan following their 2-0 win at
Fiorentina on the last day of the Serie A season on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani then announced that former player and
Brazil World Cup winning midfielder Leonardo, the club's technical director,
would be taking over the hot-seat.
</P>
<P>
A visibly emotional Ancelotti, who is widely tipped to take over at Chelsea,
told Italian Sky Sport TV: "Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an
end."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had
become the worst kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure,
however he refused to confirm that Chelsea would be his destination.
</P>
<P>
"Our paths are separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided
to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual.
</P>
<P>
"London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World
Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but was coming under heavy criticism the
last two years for failing to push champions Inter Milan closer.

Tennis: Nadal crushed by Soderling sledgehammer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of
clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings
since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month
after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third
defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said a tearful
Soderling who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of myself. This is the best win of my career against a man who is
the greatest claycourt player in history. But I told myself before the match
that I had to believe I could win."
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to
the Spaniard's 33.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Notorcycling: Stoner ends Rossi's seven year reign at Mugello
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SCARPERIA, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand
Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here.
</P>
<P>
The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race
of the season.
</P>
<P>
He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the
championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back.
</P>
<P>
Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for
the harder compound.
</P>
<P>
"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. The race was really
difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. The choice of hards
was made even though I wanted the soft ones."
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap
and skidded at the start.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can’t really believe the race
today, it was like a movie," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This morning in the warm-up I was quite worried because I was slow in the rain,
then on the formation lap I slid off into the gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
"On the grid I tried not to think about the crash, I just tried to focus. But
then I had a big slide off the line and the first part of the race wasn’t so
good for me.
</P>
<P>
"It’s a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today,
so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. I’m really happy with
this result."
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>
<P>
He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.
</P>
<P>
Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a
second.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and
immediately dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and
Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long
straight at the beginning of the second lap.
</P>
<P>
Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi
started to move up from fifth.
</P>
<P>
However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was
clearly fastest in the wet.
</P>
<P>
Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh
lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change
of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace.
</P>
<P>
Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and
35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with
Stoner and Dovizioso.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth
and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits,
essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass
Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was
over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best
finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the
pits to change his bike.
</P>
<P>
It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track
for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into
their new tyres.

Cycling: Russian delight as Menchov wins Tour of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday following the
14.4 kilometres time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist - who is the third Russian to win the race - won despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the stage.
</P>
<P>
Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca finished second with his compatriot Franco
Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18min 42sec with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's
Edvald Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in it's centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride.
</P>
<P>
However quick thinking from his mechanic may have secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained 21sec on his rival to win by 41sec overall.
</P>
<P>
Pellizotti finished just under two minutes down with Tour de France champion
Carlos Sastre fourth and seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong 12th.

ICRC 'gravely concerned' at Pakistan's Swat Valley situation
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials who visited Pakistan's Swat Valley said Sunday they
were "gravely concerned" over the humanitarian situation as Pakistani soldiers
battled to crush the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"The organisation is gravely concerned about the plight of civilians in Swat and
believes their situation demands a prompt and comprehensive humanitarian
response," said a statement released from the Geneva headquarters of the
International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay," said Pascal
Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional
resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our
teams to deliver," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers had been alarmed at what they saw when they entered the region,
where the fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters for the pass
month has left civilians trapped and isolated for weeks.
</P>
<P>
"There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce," said Daniel
O'Malley, who led the IRCR team into the region.
</P>
<P>
"Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and
are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers were also disturbed at conditions in Khwazakhela hospital, one
of the few medical facilities still left operating in Swat.
</P>
<P>
"The handful of hospital staff left are struggling to work without any water,
electricity or supplies," said O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
"They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients."
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross evacuated 14 patients from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary Syed Athar Ali said Sunday the army was gaining on
the Taliban and fighting could be over in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, a critical
milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100
kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
The defence chief told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted
northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to 10 percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest
including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave
the region.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is one of the very few humanitarian organizations working in Swat
before the conflict broke out and has been trying to return there since early
this month. Despite some openings it said access to areas affected by the
fighting remains too limited.
</P>
<P>
It also continues to support camps run by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society,
where over 20,000 people driven from their homes by the fighting are currently
living.

Tennis: Nadal crushed by Soderling sledgehammer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of
clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings
since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month
after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third
defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Boyle looks to the future despite British talent show defeat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was plotting her future Sunday
after her defeat in the "Britain's Got Talent" television show, which made her a
worldwide star thanks to Internet exposure.
</P>
<P>
Boyle, a frumpy, 48-year-old church volunteer, will reportedly earn up to eight
million pounds (nine million euros, 13 million dollars) in the next year from a
record deal, a book about her life and even a film.
</P>
<P>
She is set to start rehearsing for an album of showtunes this week and will fly
to Prague next month for recording sessions with the Czech National Symphony
Orchestra, British media said.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's career looks likely to reach new heights even though she lost to the
multi-ethnic street dancers Diversity in a public vote after the live talent
show final late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges, she was forced into
second place. The "best people won", she said, wishing the dance troupe winners
"all the best".
</P>
<P>
After the contest, "Britain's Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan called her "the
greatest discovery the show's ever found".
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm only sorry that the extraordinary tidal wave of publicity she
attracted meant so many people got either bored or irritated by Boyle mania and
decided not to vote for her as a result," he wrote on his blog.
</P>
<P>
Boyle has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video
footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical
"Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube.
</P>
<P>
It has had at least 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including
actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi, who embraced the dowdy spinster
from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final
performance, there were fears that Boyle, who was starved of oxygen at birth and
has mild learning difficulties, was suffering under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
She was spoken to by police after an outburst at the London hotel where she was
staying, while Morgan described her as "a frightened rabbit in headlights" and
said she had considered quitting the contest.
</P>
<P>
But in a live performance in the final Saturday, she proved the critics wrong
and repeated her audition piece with gusto.
</P>
<P>
Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress --
was asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth
it!... I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends."
</P>
<P>
As for her future plans, she added: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just
play it by ear. What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling."
</P>
<P>
A total of 19.2 million people watched the show in Britain, making it the most
popular television programme for five years.
</P>
<P>
Just under four million people voted, broadcaster ITV said, with 24.9 percent
backing Diversity and 20.2 percent Boyle.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's performance was also watched by hundreds of fans in her home town of
Blackburn, outside Edinburgh, where she lives in social housing with only her
cat Pebbles for company.
</P>
<P>
"She told me that after the final, she wants to come back and resume her
previous life," one of Boyle's neighbours, 24-year-old housewife Vicky McLean
told the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't want to make millions and go to America, she just wants to sing. I
think all she really hopes to have out of it is enough money to buy her house."

a special significance for his side after their country had become a virtual
'no-go zone' for international cricket.
</P>
<P>
A terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March saw seven of their
players and English assistant coach Paul Farbrace injured.
</P>
<P>
Eight Pakistanis, including six security force personnel, were killed.
</P>
<P>
With no international side willing to travel to Pakistan, Younus's men recently
returned to international action in the United Arab Emirates against Australia,
where they lost 3-2 in a one-day series but won the lone Twenty20.
</P>
<P>
"It is special to be back on the world stage, especially in Twenty20 and in
England, the media are here so lots of hopes are here," the talented batsman
told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are suffering from not playing regularly, and no-one is coming to Pakistan,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan endured a nailbiting defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India in the
2007 World Twenty20 final in South Africa and Younus would love nothing more
than for his team to go one better this time.
</P>
<P>
"My confidence is that I'll take this trophy to Pakistan," he said. But such has
been Pakistan's relative lack of international cricket that he added: "It will
be an achievement for us to finish in the top four."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the 2007 final, Younus said: "The finishing touches were not
there. We needed only five runs. But it was fantastic to be a part of that team
in the final.
</P>
<P>
"Some guys were crying at the end, but hopefully we'll have the finishing
touches," Younus said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty20 tends to put a premium on big-hitting batsmen at the start of the
innings but Younus, whose team face England and the Netherlands in Group B, said
it was not necessary to start going for big shots right from the off.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty20 looks short, but it's not - 120 balls is enough.
</P>
<P>
"If you bat normally but with energy, especially in the middle order and with
good runners between the wickets, 180-90 is very easy.
</P>
<P>
"In English conditions the new ball does seam, so you need someone like Salman
Butt who can play for 20 overs. But in the middle order, we have big hitters
like Shahid Afridi and Misbah-Ul-Haq."
</P>
<P>
English officials have already announced that plans are well advanced for
Pakistan to play two Tests against Australia in England next year as well as a
series with Andrew Strauss's men.
</P>
<P>
Large Asian communities in England provide Pakistan with a ready-made fan base
and Younus said: "Playing in England is everyone's dream. My first Test at
Lord's was fantastic for me.
</P>
<P>
"England is the home of cricket, it is an achievement for us to play Tests here,
and maybe ODIs too. It's good for the youngsters to play in England and the old
guys have a lot of friends here.
</P>
<P>
"We need the passion in Twenty20 and in England, a lot of followers all the
time, a lot of cities have Pakistanis and Indians. That's the main reason I'm
happy to be in England."
</P>
<P>
Younus added: "If we play good cricket it will be good for our nation. These
days all the nation is depressed.
</P>
<P>
"Only cricket - if we play well and win something - they will cheer. To finish
in the top four, my nation will come again and start cheering."

Myanmar's Suu Kyi trades barbs with junta over trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YANGON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's military junta accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit
to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit
back against the "bullying" generals.
</P>
<P>
The regime said the Nobel laureate was not above the law and issued its sternest
warning yet against foreign interference in the case, under which she faces up
to five years' jail for breaching her house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed prison trial,
insisting that she only offered "temporary shelter" to American John Yettaw
after he swam to her lakeside house, and has branded the proceedings as biased.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," Aye Myint said. "She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided
him food and shelter."
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her
crumbling lakeside mansion. She was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison
and charged on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old opposition leader met with her lawyers at the jail on Saturday
ahead of final arguments in the case, which are due to be heard on Friday. A
guilty verdict is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Her party said Sunday that she was upset that Myanmar authorities had entered
her residential compound without permission to stage a reconstruction of
Yettaw's visit for the purposes of the trial.
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the
authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got
into the property)," party spokesman Nyan Win told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in accordance with the law. She said it was unjust bullying," added
Nyan Win, who is also part of her legal team.
</P>
<P>
Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May
6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers
and spending two nights there.
</P>
<P>
He has told the court that he had had a vision that Aung San Suu Kyi would be
assassinated by "terrorists" and was told by God to warn both the opposition
leader and the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement to the court this week that she could not
be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having
reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
However Nyan Win quoted the democracy campaigner as saying that she "has no
grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family."
</P>
<P>
International critics accuse Myanmar's military regime of trumping up the
charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest
six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech in Singapore, Myanmar's Aye Myint said the case against Aung
San Suu Kyi was an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
"It is the universal legal principle that no one is above the law," he said
</P>
<P>
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, speaking at the same forum on Saturday,
pressed Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi and said there needed to be "real
change in Burma". Burma is Myanmar's former name.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, made a
similar call on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar last week hit back at rare criticism from the normally placid fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the treatment
of the democracy campaigner.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, whose country holds the rotating
chairmanship of the 10-member bloc, said ASEAN leaders would discuss Myanmar at
a summit in South Korea on June 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile more than 100 people rallied in Singapore late Sunday as part of a
regional effort by civil rights groups to press Myanmar's military rulers to
release Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Similar rallies were also held simultaneously in Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, organisers said.

British PM says won't quit as poll predicts Euro election rout
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a
scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party
before crunch European and local elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I
believe in".
</P>
<P>
Every lawmaker would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last
four years, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said
they will resign since the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
The leaked expenses claims have shown that Members of Parliament have claimed
from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island.
</P>
<P>
A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested that three weeks of revelations by the
Daily Telegraph newspaper would hit Brown hard at the European and local
elections, in which Britons vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It suggested Labour would come third in the European elections with just 17
percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and second opposition centrist
