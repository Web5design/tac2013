3	[With recent reports that Homeland Security has ordered the delivery of 450,000,000 hollow point bullets for its use, more than one bullet for every man woman and child alive today in this country, with Barack Obama, the Office Of White House Communications, mediamatters, and especially MSNBC's Al Sharpton busily trying to orchestrate and foment a Race War bringing about Barack's very own "Reichstag Fire Moment" when he can suspend the Constitution and remove the irritation, chafing and constraints the Bill of Rights places upon him, this is a pertinent question.]"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizens?The question of troop involvement in a possible upcoming Martial Law scenario that is being predicted is no imaginary possibility  nor is it a conspiracy theory.Many readers will recall the survey given to U.S. Marines at the 29 Palms Marine Corps base in California.The survey asked the respondents to consider the following statement: I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.The current situation is even more alarming, for example:The passing of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which THEBLAZE covers in an article titled, Can the Indefinite Detention Bill Send Americans to Military Prison Without Trial? (12-08-11) has caused even the most skeptic to be concerned for their personal safety  especially those fighting for liberty.The National Defense Resources Preparedness: Comparing Previous Executive Orders article that theintelhub.com posted online is another example of the emergence of a Fascist Police State taking complete control.Lastly, the purchase by the Department of Homeland Security of 450,000,000 rounds of ammunition over a five year period should be warning enough that something is definitely wrong.Who are these rounds to be used on? Even at 80,000,000 rounds per year, thats one bullet for every dissenter at a minimum."
4	Will?They have.
5	My little tin hat, my little tin hat, my little tin hat...................Here come the nice nurses with the pretty little pills..........
6	We have so many foreigners in our military it's not like they would be firing on their own citizens.
7	Yes...without question. Only after a period of time will that backfire.
8	Once those Marines lose a couple of buddies to raging gun nuts, I'm sure they would have no problem returning fire with a vengeanceDrug Enforcement Agents have no problem exchanging fire with drug dealers........they are American Citizens
9	Sure, didn't that already happen in the Watts Riots and such?
10	Living in fear is not living.
11	But the military supports Ron Paul I've read, where is THIS odd idea from?
12	Yes. They're going to kill you if you dissent. That's what you want to believe, so believe it.
13	Wolverines!
14	Firing on citizens has already occurred.Are you talking out and out battles? Like a war on the citizens from the government?
15	Yes.
16	Sure they will. They're a bunch of useless, unemployable meatheads.
17	Why is this thread posted in Politics? I find its offensive and based on abject ignorance. Linked below is a history lesson all of us should know:
18	Oh yes..... RedDawnEvery gun hoarders fantasy
19	Yeah, it's still a mystery as to how Janet Reno was never held accountable for the Waco massacre. She didn't even lose her job as Attorney General. What a disgrace.
20	Those in the compound were murderers and had been given ample opportunity to surrender. It was Koresh who killed everyone
21	Not by the Regular Army in the U.S.
22	Regular Army would not be required to take care of a couple of law breaking gun nuts. Local law enforcement could handle them
23	Great! I couldn't have said it any better
24	I doubt that the troops would even think twice about it. They have a previous history of doing it.
25	As incompetent as Janet Reno was, she wasn't responsible for Waco, any more than the attorney general of the time was responsible for Jonestown.When these kinds of "I am God" cults form, everyone who joins is already dead. They are just waiting for the order. Eventually these madmen demand that their followers die to prove their belief and devotion. Waco is no different from Jonestown or from Heaven's Gate.
26	"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizens?The same idiots who don't know that it's not "Citizen's" but "citizens"?If the stupid fucks who write that shitty blog can't do grammer right, what else are they obviously screwing up about?
27	I see you moved from goat sucker to worthless troll !
28	You mean again? Or if they are asked to carry out an unconstitutional order to confiscate guns from american citizens?
29	Yep
30	Regular troops? So long as their commanders tell them the order is lawful; (whether it is or not) yes, they will, without hesitation. Which I suppose means, that if The Anointed One were to declare Martial Law, I'll find myself facing our own guys; sad; friendly fire....isn't.
31	Conspiracy Theories???
32	Grammar.Knowing the difference between "knowing you're shit" and "knowing your shit"You know you're shit, right?
33	Quite possibly; but, what IF this or any other president decides to say, suspend the constitution-what then? Crawl, or take a side? All I know, is that the oath I took was to the constitution, not the country, not the president, not the army, so I guess that would put me on the side opposing anyone who suspended or violated it.
34	He'll have a tough time "declaring martial law"......................................:cuckoo :
35	Every military member in every service is taught in basic training to obey lawful orders, failure to do so means a punitive action can be taken against you, up to and including a court-martial and a possible prison term, depending on the circumstances. But the key word in all that is LAWFUL; the military are not expected to be automatons, indiscriminately killing somebody just cuz somebody else told 'em to.Should the military be called on in cases of emergency to quell violence and restore order, I am certain that the rules of engagement will be clear, and everyone will know what to do under whatever the circumstances might be. Every soldier will know that, so if the situation demands it they will do their duty. If that means firing on US citizens, then yes, they will do it.
36	There are enough foreigners serving in our military to make the question moot. There are enough gang bangers in the military and if all those aren't enough, the UN will supply troops to make sure there are.
37	How come the only people here I see using terms like that to refer to our President are Righties?
38	What do YOU know about our military?
39	Just one of the many times.also on striking miners in Colorado and WVA. Heck the president even ordered a bombing run on striking miners in WVA. However it was bad weather and one plane crashed and the other one got lost.
40	when we vote this black trash outta office then we can hunt thier ass's down.
41	The U.S. military is facing a "significant criminal threat" from gangs, including prison and biker gangs, whose members have found their way into the ranks, according to an FBI-led investigation.Some gang members get into the military to escape the streets, but then end up reconnecting once in, while others target the services specifically for the combat and weapons training, the National Gang Intelligence Center says in a just-released 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment/Emerging Trends.Thank you for this opportunity to educate you since you won't do it yourself.
42	Be still my heart.I served for 21 years in the military....you?
43	[/QUOTELMFAO
44	Bull fuckin shit.
45	FYI - the military does allow non-citizens to enlist in the military. But they must attain citizenship or they cannot re-enlist, and so their influence is quite minimal. And let me say this further about them and the gangbangers and such: the military has some bad people in it, as we've seen in the news every so often. Most get weeded out in basic training, you either conform or you get kicked out for the most part. Trust me, those TIs are good at finding and eliminating the malcontents, although a few do get through. But the foreigners, the gangbangers, the bad element, guys know who they're sharing a foxhole with, or who the guys are in their outfit that they can trust and who they can't. Doesn't matter what their background is, it's not like ordinary natural Americans don't have problems too. So this issue is making a mountainout of a very small molehill.
46	It started early in America when George Washington led 15,000 militia to quell the rebellion in PA against the Whiskey tax.Militia/National Guard troops have been used against American citizens several times since.Then lets not forget the Civil War.
47	Well I understand that, US National Guard troops also fired on people during the Watts Riots, but the poster I was responding to said the troops have a previous history of doing it, which troops is he talking about? I served in the Military from 2000-2007, never had to fire on any US Civilians, I still know people serving and they haven't had to either, my point is THIS Military has no experience firing upon crowds of American Civilians. The things we are talking about happened before our troops today were even born.
48	lets forget you !!!
49	Blair Mountain.
50	What you say is true; my problem is with Desperado's assertion that the troops wouldn't think twice about firing on American citizens. Yeah, they would, I hope we never put them in a position to face that situation. I do not appreciate the notion that US soldiers would easily open fire with no qualms about it. As HG says, that is Bull Fuckin' Shit.
51	Our way of mocking the way some of his young followers almost deified him in the last campaign. To me, he's an empty suit, a younger, more eloquent version of John Kerry, a Liberal ideologue and political hack who has never held a real job-just an academic and community activist who stands for everything I despise politically, and not very much that I am for politically. We see him like your side saw Bush. Personally I see him as another Ivy League, intellectual snob (I never have yet met one I liked); a permanent civilian, who never served his country (Ivy Leaguers consider themselves too good for that), who never learned the first thing about discipline, leadership or respect, much less courage; and in recent times, a pompous ass as well. In short, I don't like the man, as a president, or as a person; not someone I'd care to share a drink and conversation with, under any circumstances. I don't have any problem figuring out that someone who refers to people like me as "the enemy" is in fact, my enemy. I'll support him beyond the water's edge out of respect for the office; but I will oppose him here at home and do all I can to defeat him in November.
52	Yup, like I said our Troops currently serving never had to fire upon crowds of their fellow citizens, to say they would just do it and not care is bullshit. Comments like that just show far the divide is now between our civilian sector and our Military/Veterans, civilians really don't know shit about the Military.
53	I personally remember Kent state.The point is precedents have been set many times and they WILL do it again.
54	I hope your wrong.
55	First, the only way that martial law would be declared would be a national disaster such as the eruption of Yellowstone, or a nuclear exchange with a major nation. Other than that, it is all in you wingnuts imaginaton.Second, for there to be a major event where you wound have troops firing on citizens, you would have to have something like one of the fringe lunatic militias occupy a town and shooting citizens.
56	So?Maybe we need more foreign mercenaries in the military. If we have a military formed of mercenaries and gang bangers are they more or less inclined to open fire on Americans? Isn't this a good thing?You didn't happen to be lying when you were in the military were you? Your service wasn't illegal was it? Didn't you say you were a lesbian? So what's the deal with phony service based on a lie????
57	How is it relevant if she was a Lesbian?
58	If that caldera in Yellowstone goes, we won't need troops, there won't be much of anything left.
59	We just had an end to Don't Ask Don't Tell. A lesbian would have been dismissed.Before 1993, when Clinton passed DADT homosexuality was totally banned in the military. So, yes, it would have been relevant since a homosexual would have lied to join and lied to stay.
60	Well I don't know too much about the rules back than since I was not in, but I thought you could only get thrown out of the Military for actually commiting homosexual acts? I worked in Separations and I saw a few women discharged for having sex with other women, and not all of them were gay, one of them was married as a matter a fact.
61	If she was having sex with another woman, yes she was a lesbian. Even if she was married.Not that there is anything wrong with lesbians as people They shouldn't lie about it, nor should they expect concessions for it.
62	I could see why you would say that, although I have known plenty of women who had sex with other women and they don't say they are gay, mostly bisexual or something they wanted to try, thats what they tell me anyways.
63	The miners were opposed by a well-armed contingent of mine guards and State Police with rifles and machine guns. These would eventually be joined by 2,000 U.S. Army troops armed with airplanes, bombs, and poison gas. The two forces met at Blair Mountain, in Logan County. The coal company forces held fortified positions along the ridge; the miners labored in the heat of late summer to climb the mountain with hopes of engaging company forces at the summit.
64	if anything they'll fire on the WH. they hate that cocksuckers guts that much. boys fire at will
65	You know you are a goat sucking worthless troll, right?
66	keep it rollin
67	My, my. Perhaps you need a little visit from the secret service. And need to visit a psychologist.
68	my my its a fact democraps hate the military. I can assue you there's no love loss
69	Democrat FDR made us a Superpower
70	Democrat LBJackass mades us fools
71	So Did Republican Bush
72	I think his surge in 07 ended it before he left office. Obozo made a campaign promise to end a war that was over duh
73	A surge was only necessary because Bush abandoned the war on terrorism to blunder into Iraq"They will treat us as liberators"
74	In September 2008, Obama told Fox News Channels Bill OReilly, I think that the surge has succeeded in ways that nobody anticipated.  Its succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.
75	A surge that was only necessary to save Bush's butt after he blundered into Iraq
76	Waco wasn't a "massacre". What it was..was a travesty. How they let a Christian Terrorist Pedophile, like David Koresh yammer on for several months is beyond me.And why some conservatives defend that piece of fucking shit..is pathetic.
77	wonderful read folksi can sense the anxiety, the 'my team' hope and fear among you allbut most of all, the utter division, social and politicalthat, and that alone is enough to warrant bad news taking the riens~S~
78	he blundered into nothing. he had the full support of the house and senate including the democraps WHO LEAD THE FUCKIN' WAY
79	The majority of Democrats voted against authorizing an invasionBut, ultimately it was Bush the decider who made the blunder
80	the majority voted for it. except Ted Kennedy who was too drunk to know what was going on, and voted against it.
81	We should be thankful that libtards don't like or own guns. LOL, chaos should be over by sunrise.
82	More Democrats voted against going into Iraq than in favor..It's historical record. Your opinion doesn't change it
83	hand em out
84	We've been a Superpower since the late 1700s.Remember? When we defeated the world's greatest Superpower, England, at the time??
85	Its too idiotic to be imagined or to even qualify as a theory.
86	That was immediately what I thought of too.In general, you don't use the military for civilian peacekeeping because the military trains its soldiers to use lethal force. If faced with resistance, the training kicks in and that's that. I don't blame soldiers for that, it's just how they're trained.
87	With the help of France and Spain, the world's other two super powers at the time.
88	And we took away all their shit too
89	20 children and two pregnant women, among all the murderers, deserved to die in an illicit invasion ordered by J. Reno?
90	so whats your answer Rocks?.....will they?....or will they not?....
91	BIG difference between a Drug Dealer and a Law-Abiding Citizen RW.....one would shoot you without a thought.....the other would think about it....and we are not talking about DEA agents.....we are talking about the US Military....once again....BIG difference.....
92	one of the reason's you ran right Gordo?.....you opened your yap to some Military Vet and he beat your ass and scared you so bad you were on the first plane south....those Muslims you thought were coming capped the deal.....you were gone like the coward you are....
93	Spain? LOL
94	Reno is a criminal. She burned and gassed those poor kids. It was absolutely unnecessary. But no one held her accountable. And that's even more criminal.
95	exactly.....i believe the question was asked about today's Military.... not what happened in 1817.............
96	If you are firing on our military, you are not a law abiding citizen
97	The gang (yes they were a gang) in that compound murdered four federal agents and were hiding behind children like the cowards they were. What parent would allow their children to be used as shields? The same parent who would allow Koresh to sexually molest their childrenThey asked for and deserved their fate
98	Holding government officials unaccountable for crimes they commit against the American public seems to be a growing trend the last few administrations. Of course, this latestabberation absolutely takes the cake. The obama administration has taken abuse of the citizens to a high art form, shredding the Constitution and the Rule of Law savagely and continuously.Personally, I doubt this administration will trust American troops to follow orders to the extent of firing on their own. We've seen information that indicates this administration considers military veterans as potential terrorists. Unless he segregates the troops and garrisons troops of different ethnicity in neighborhoods to be controlled. With the level of racial tension this CinC is fostering and fomenting, that would be one way to get Americans to fire on other Americans. The other possibility is that this administration declares marshal law and invites the UN to send troops.
99	What decent government would murder children just to "get at" their parents, cowardly or otherwise? I assume you consider liberal pols cowardly, then? They hide behind children all the time in order to protect themselves and their pet projects.
100	There's an argument to be made that the Spanish-American War, where we finished taking away all of Spain's toys, was the point where we became a super power.We weren't a superpower coming out of the Revolutionary War. A lot of the Founders were legitimately concerned we'd collapse quickly. We damn near did in the War of 1812.
101	Law enforcement was in an impossible situation in Waco, one in which the parents of those children put themselves in. It's analogous to when a police officer finds themselves in a hostage situation where a parent, out of their mind, has a gun on the kids. You know the parent is unstable and could shoot the kids at any time, and you also know that if you act, you risk the kids getting shot. So what's the right choice? Wait and hope reason prevails or act and hope you can move fast enough to save the kids?I don't think anyone would say that Waco was a perfect example of law enforcement, but considering that it was the cult that precipitated and continued the stand off when they could have stood down at any time, I'm not that sympathetic for the adults involved. Take a shot at a cop or a soldier and don't be surprised when they shoot right back.The kids though... that is a tragedy. Goddamn wacko parents that put their kids in situations like that.
102	Sorry..I started to answer your post, but then realized it made no sense
103	Yup.
104	you dont like addressing questions do ya?....you were talking DEA Agents RW.....the thread is about the Military.....not Police....they fire quite often on Citizens.....and who was firing on the Military?....you SPUN the Question around.....lets take your spin off....its would the US Military fire against Citizens of the USA....
105	"Will US Troops Fire On US Citizens?"if ii could make bloody letter too.Hmm? I hope so, this how to impose “rights” on the peopleHopefully for the last time! In this manner. btw is it not less then 400m w/ illegals so we need more ammo?
106	First of all, Marines would not be involved in engaging gun nuts screaming "from my cold dead fingers" it is not their mission. ATF agents and local authorities would handle itAs a gun owner, you have a constitutional right to own weapons. You do not have a constitutional right to kill people trying to take your weapon. If authorities come to your door claiming you have an illegal weapon, you are required to turn it over. Your Constitutional rights are to get a lawyer and prove your second amendment rights have been violatedIf you choose to shoot it out with law enforcement over your rights to own guns.....you are a criminalThe same as a drug dealer shooting it out trying to protect his turf
107	Yep that is the constitution.
108	I think it's worth pointing out the larger principle here which is this:Even if your rights are being violated, once you make a decision to use violence against law enforcement officials, even if they are in the wrong, you likely won't live to make your case in a court of law.That's just how it is. Once bullets are flying the only folks that care about your Constitutional rights are your heirs who will be profiting from the lawsuit they file with the cops.That's even more true if you're in a scenario where the US Military is being used to enforce the law. There aren't many folks out there that can say they started a firefight with a Marine because most of the folks stupid enough to do so are now dead. Just because you're a civilian doesn't mean they won't respond with overwhelming force of you start crap.
109	Already answered that. Blair Mountain.
110	the question was...would the US Military fire on its own citizens?....not COPS......the guy who started the thread never said why the Military is on the streets to begin with....but it seems you just dont want to answer that question......why?....
111	that was over a hundred years ago....i believe the OP was talking about today....
112	Do you people vote for just the party you belong too??? Do you think out anything other then what party your affliated with and obligated to vote for? Are you controlled and obligated to a party affliation or can you think outside the box?
113	The answer is a simple and resounding.....YESIf you are firing at our Marines you move from being a US Citizen to the status of criminal
114	actually this whole subject is moot......it would have to be established as to why are the troops in the streets to begin with......is it a legitimate reason?.....or not?.....
115	Gun nuts have had this "From my cold, dead fingers " fantasy where evil government is coming to take their guns away and they will fight to the death to protect their second amendment rightsIn fact, the only constitutional right of regress you have is through the courts. If you fire on law enforcement......you are a criminalNo better than a drug dealer
116	Yes, absolutely. Our Police and Military are trained to be loyal  obedient to the State. Their loyalty is not to the People. They will do what they're ordered to do without hesitation. Make no mistake about that.
117	it just may depend on the circumstances.....like why are they there?....
118	Yes it was illegal to fire on the British too. However the victor writes the rules. You will need more then luck.
119	Absolutely......if you engage in a revolutionYou better win
120	I would like to believe that too, but i just can't. They will follow orders. Their loyalty is to the State, to the State alone.
121	GOP News Flash: The real reason for soaring gas prices
122	This post was written by earthling01.
123	This post was written on 2012-03-17T12:16:00.
124	Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.
125	the right doesnt care about facts
126	All the RW war mongering in Israel and the US doesn't help either. Still no evidence Iran has actually decided to build a bomb, and this BS only helps IRAN'S RWers portray us as the great Satan, add to uncertainty, drives up prices.And hurts chances for a diplomatic and sanctions solution.
127	remember all the cheering for Bomb Bomb Bomb Iran?
128	That's Obama, right?
129	syracuse basketball, wiki
130	The national average for a gallon of gas when Obama was sworn in around $1.85 a gallon Today close to $ 4.00 dollars a gallon in a few places it is $ 4.00 dollars a gallon. This happened with the Democrats controlling the presidency and both houses of congress two thirds of which they still control.These are facts here is another one having low gas prices really gets in the way when one is trying to push a green energy agenda.
131	2008? isn't that when the Democrats were blaming Booooosh and Cheney and Halliburton for higher gasoline prices? You remember, when the price was $1.87/gallon.Speculators make bets on whether or not the price of any commodity will go up or down. The price of Gas is based largely on geo political forces and right now the Iranians are threatening to close the Straight of Hormuz effectively cutting back the work's supply of oil by about 1/5.The mere threat of a shortage has caused the price to rise by about.50/gallon. A real shortage would cause a spike unlike anything ever seen. Of course this is the wet dream of the Big 0's administration.You know what else? If Americans go to the pumps and there is no gas, they will demand that we get gas and they will not care what has to happen to get it.
132	The left absolutely Hammered President Bush about high gas prices.. Karma now biting you hypocrites in the ass innit?fucking funny as hell.
133	Bush started a war in the Middle East.
134	You're right.... it is amusing to see such blatant hypocrisy.
135	You want the government to put price controls on gas and oil?
136	Somehow I get the feeling you're not referring to the hypocrisy of all the conservatives who defended Bush back then......who are now attacking Obama.
137	Don't get it? Read it again, and again, until you do.
138	It's obama's fault, he hates oil, he said so, he hates coal, he said so, he hates fossil fuels, he said so.. it's obama's fault.
139	Wasn't that a Beach Boys Song....?
140	Chu wants 10 bucks a gallon gas.....even though he says he's changed that stance from 4 years ago.
141	Kentucky basketballSyracuse basketball.
142	Did I say that? I have said on this and other boards Presidents can't control gas prices i did not blame Bush for high gas prices and I don't blame Obama for them but the left was more than happy to lay the blame for them on Bush for political gain so I really have no problem with the right doing the same thing to Obama for the same reason.
143	“Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,” Mr. Chu, Secretary of Energy.
144	Of course Chu never said that, dittohead, or Obama the skyrocket quote. Totally duped AGAIN...
145	Maybe Dhu didn't but Chu definitely said it.
146	Democrats Blamed Bush For High Gas Prices But Not obama...Democrats Blame Bush and GOP for High Gas/Oil Pricesthat's just a few of them...
147	Then candidate Obama said he had no problem withgas prices soaring.He only had issue with the fact itwas happening so fast.He wants higher prices at the pump so Americanswill support his push for greener energy.This is a fact.
148	that's a fact. and he doesn't care onE shit about you peons suffering..because he know all and his green energy vision is the only thing he cares about..And notice all the green energy TAXPAYERS monies have went to conies who supported him..
149	Gas was pushing $4 a gallon in summer '08 before the bottom fell out. You really think the $1.85 in early '09 was the natural state?
150	I didn't think Ungar would be one to suggest oil companies are closing refineries to 'jack up prices' which you posted. And he didn't.If you read other articles he has written, it is true that EPA regulations are not forcing existing refineries to close (though those same EPA regulations ARE jacking up the price of gasoline), but EPA regulations among other factors are making it highly unattractive for oil companies to attempt to build new refineries in an environment of socioeconomic uncertainties such as are created by the threat of Cap  Trade, continued unrest in the Middle East, etc. etc. etc.There are so many factors going into the price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, that no single one can be blamed for it all. It is very true that Obama is not to blame for the high price of oil and/or high prices at the pump. But it is also true that the Obama administration has done little or nothing to allieviate the situation and has made it worse by its policy in our own Gulf of Mexico and other coastal waters, nixing the pipeline, and doing nothing to alleviate fears re regulations still overing overhead. A few cents here, a few cents there, eventually adds up to a dollar and a savings of $10.00 to $20.00 or more at the pump. And that factors into everything we buy that is manufactured using petroleum products or transported by machines using petroleum products. Obama gets most of his campaign contributions from Wall Street so he is unlikely to rock the boat in the futures market which could easily be done in the interest of the general welfare to rein in speculators that are hurting us all.You have to approach it from a macroeconomics perspective, not a single issue perspective.Ten years ago, the call to open up ANWR and the Bakkan fields, etc. were met with objections that we wouldn't see any difference in supply or at the pump for at least ten years. Well, it is now ten years later. If we had done it then, we would be better off now. But we're still hearing the same arguments. It will take too long to accomplish improvements when we need the relief now, so we won't do the improvements.
151	The oil companys think they can defeat Obama by raising prices just like they Dropped prices before the 2008 elections.
152	Doesn't it embarrass you at all to make absurd statements like that? Why shoudl the oil companies want to defeat Obama? They are making billions on his policies without having to lift much of a finger. They don't like it really, but why would they fight it?If the government ever did get it right so that the oil companies had to go back to work to make a profit and expand, we would see a dramatic improvement in a relatively short time.
153	I'd much rather they put a little control on the EPA.
154	In a 2008 interview with The Wall Street Journal before he was appointed President Obamas energy secretary, Dr. Chu, then the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said, Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels of Europe.
155	How bout dem 5 million jobs in the energy industry?Solyndra's doing a bang up job with hiring all those hundreds of thousands of pe.... hmm? what? Bankrupt you say? Laid off most of it's staff while giving it's execs millions in bonuses? Made huge contributions to liberal groups for political action?Huh.
156	Good find., But the fact is, high gas prices are not Obama's fault. It IS his fault that he hasn't done anything practical to move us toward more energy independence and in fact has thrown up some roadblocks toward that goal.Nevertheless, to put things into their proper perspective, it is time to again post this Jon Stewart piece that has already become a classic. It is positively brilliant. Can't find it on Youtube, but this take you right to the source:
157	Obama ATTACKED the oil companies AGAIN TODAY in his silly little speech...so fer sure he gives a shit about you all paying high gas prices...suckers go vote for the idiot AGAIN
158	Like I said, read it again. Read it until you understand it.The refineries are producing so much gas they can export it at good profit and still meet US demand.Americans are willing to pay the price on the pump, so why would a gas station lower it?Especially, why would a seller of gas lower the price to Americans when foreign buyers will pay better?THINK. USE YOUR HEAD.
159	Chu doesn't control prices anyway.Our refiners are EXPORTING gasoline. Do you understand the implications? Do you have the sense and integrity to try?
160	Why?There is so much gasoline being produced in the US that refineries are exporting it, and Americans are WILLING to pay 4 bucks a gallon.How do YOU fix that?
161	The administration isn't doing anything to push up gas prices. U.S. gasoline is being EXPORTED, there's so much of it.Why can't you understand that?
162	What can he do to lower gas prices, short of government price controls?There's already more gasoline being produced in the US than we need. Why isn't that lowering prices?
163	The GOP doesn't like it when they think the government is messing with the free market.Got news for you, it's the SPECULATORS who make you pay an extra 50 cents/gal over at Wall St.And, if oil companies start posting record profits again this summer? EVERYONE is going to know who's fault it is for high gas prices.And...........it ain't Obama's.
164	What we need is a national integrated oil company. Give all the rights to all the oil on federal lands and waters. Let it drill it, refine it, and sell it at cost,in the US only.
165	Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel with a mandate that the refineries remove the sulfur, a very expensive process.4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.
166	Totally consistent with his Weekly Address and the OP. Obama is blaming big oil for the price of oil, both then and now.
167	The average price of a gallon of gas peaked in 2007, just before the collapse of the Bush economy. Would you like to bring back that surefire Bush policy of bringing the price of oil down, i.e. put us on the brink of full financial collapse?
168	Yeah, obama doing what he always does...BLAME someone else..I'm surprised he didn't blame Boooooooooooooooooooosh today..
169	Because Bush's policies of weaning us from big oil at the time were to give big oil more tax breaks, and let them do whatever the hell they please to us. At least Obama is launching significant programs to lead us to energy independence, and weaning us from our reliance on oil.
170	Nope, Obama analytically assesses causality. It's the wingnuts here who mindlessly blaming Obama.
171	Ah no...it's not just wingnuts blaming the boyking...look at the polls..And the Democrats jumped on Bush for high gas prices, so I guess what goes around COMES around...tsk tsk
172	Why do you even bother posting? You are about as dumb as a fucking brick.
173	Dumbfuck....Speculators see Obamination constantly preventing more drilling in the US, thus they project higher oil prices in the long term.You assholes prevent drilling going back decades but then claim drilling now won't affect "today's price." Well, what you did before and what you do now does affect today's price and tomorrow's price because we know you are trying to limit supply to drive everyone into fairy dust cars.
174	There are no programs from O that are leading us to energy independence. His delusions of fantasy world ie solar, wind are supplemental at best. If he were interested in leading us, we would be drilling more offshore leases in proven play areas where porosities and permeabilities have already been determinged through physical analysis.
175	Keep fucking with Liberty, and you have a revolt on your hands...WE are headed down that road.
176	Because the poster has just enough brainpower to post?
177	Nice...Where did that gem come from? Ever heard of souces? Of course not.
178	That is the most imcomprehensible part of the Obama energy policy. He won't let U.S. oil companies drill in the gulf and allowed all those off shore rigs go to other countries and we'll have hell to pay to ever get them back. This has cost us millions of barrels of oil and I think thousands of jobs in some of our poorest states that really needed those jobs. And he has further targeted the oil companies, alone among industries, with significantly higher taxes.But we're subsidzing countries like Columbia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico who are drilling for oil in the Gulf as well as importing oil from them. (And who got those rigs that the Obama administration wouldn't allow here.) And the government didn't say boo to the Russians who recently announced they plan to do some drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
179	International economy, don't ya know? Obama was brought up beliving, and seeking that the united States was the incarnation of evil in the world...now that HE is POTUS?Time to make the United States pay it back...to take them down a few notches and make them like everyone else.THAT is the agenda.Don't doubt me on this...
180	Was Obama lying in 2008?
181	With his failures with Solyndra and others?He IS hugely a LIAR.Obamabots don't care. They are getting thier Obamamoney...
182	Maybe some of it is a conspiracy to knock off Obama? and maybe we will have rumors/facts that prices will begin to fall after Obama loses? that would be great! Can we vision the headline: Gas Prices to fall after Obama loses in November. Kinda like, Economy will rebound when Romney wins.
183	I recommend that everybody listen to that ad one more time before reading this written in May 2010:
184	Too stupid to know how to click on the link I provided? What a moron.
185	Does the fact that oil is an globally traded commodity, and we're now a drop in the bucket, elude you?
186	Not at all...NOT convinced.
187	Keep this graph in that pointy little head of yours.
188	Don't let actual data get in the way of your wishful thinking.
189	"Adjusted for 1979 Dollars"...
190	"Adjusted for 1979 Dollars"...really Dickhead?
191	And perhaps you would like to put that graph into its proper perspective by reading over this very comprehensive analysis by the Brooking Institute, nobody's idea of a rightwing organization:CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES of the OIL SHOCK of 2007/08
192	Don't let actual Life experiences get in YOUR way...asshole.
193	Gas prices are high because that's where obama wants them to be. Every speech is give is not about how to bring prices down, or changing his idiotic policies, it's about his vision of green energy and how he's dragging us into this bold and beautiful tomorrow.Fool. Just an idiot. I can hardly wait until the moving vans pull up in front of the white house and restores some of the integrity it used to have.
194	Either inflation adjusted or actual, the data proves that gas prices hit their peak under Bush, in June 2008. It also shows the nose dive as the Bush economy put us close to financial collapse. Just want to provide your circle jerk buddy a reality check then next time he wants to claim how cheap gas was when Bush took office, and leaving out the reason. That's called a lie of omission.Got it yet, moron?
195	Adjusted for 1979 dollars, Gracie?
196	None of that matters as long as the refineries have overseas buyers willing to pay these prices for gas. What do you think happens to gas prices as more and more Chinese, and Indians, for example, actually get to where they can afford a car?
197	That's what the bottom line says, doesn't it? That's the year where the x-axis begins, doesn't it? Were you home schooled or something? Is your problem that you're too dumb to have ever seen a financial chart which is adjusted for inflation?
198	1979 Gracie?
199	No. 1 on my list addresses that issues and could take care of it. The other issues are all costs that refineries have to add into the wholesale price of gasoline that the stations have to pass on plus some to cover the taxes and their profit. There is no shortage of domestic fuel supply. So lowering the cost for the manufacturer translates into a lower cost at the pump. A lower cost at the pump then generates more demand as people can afford to travel and drive for pleasure again, and the oil companies would enjoy profits from that too.In the 1970's, there was supposedly a true gasoline shortage. Stations ran out of fuel and when a station did get a supply, there were long lines and long waits to get your car to the pump while you prayed that the station wouldn't run out of gas or your car wouldn't run out of gas before you got to the pump. That along with high prices for the fuel, high unemployment, double digit inflation, and double digit interest rates was a big reason Jimmy Carter was so thoroughly defeated in his re-election bid.We are seeing no shortages of fuel anywhere right now. A much different dynamic is in effect.
200	I loved this tidbit about how the Moonie Times and Weekly Standard tried to distort the story.
201	One dynamic is that economy standards have almost doubled on most average sedans, and quadrupled on hybrids. Our consumption of oil is down significantly from what it was in the '70s, in spite of population growth, and more cars on the road. Add to that the fact that our gas is blended with ethanol. I saw a figure that America now consumes about 5.3 million barrels a day. In the '70s we were over 8 million bbls/day.The simple issue is that people in India and China, the two most populace countries, aren't traveling by bike as much these days. They're rapidly emerging, with a strong middle class, who want cars. Exxon, Mobil, Shell, BP could double their capacity, but they're going to sell at world prices. They're not in business to help Americans get cheap gas, they'll sell at what the market is willing to pay. Whether it's drilled here or in Saudi Arabia isn't going to change the price.
202	WTF is the Moonie Times?
203	It won't change the price of a barrel of oil as that is set by the world market. But policy could change the price of a gallon of gasoline if the Administration wanted to help the American people. And they could do that with a policy that would provide the incentive for the oil companies to give the American people a break in return or making their profits on the world market.The oil industry has not been a free market industry for decades now. It is among the most highly regulated industry in the country and the government does have the power to make a difference. But it has to be done in a way that profits everybody. Try to punish the oil industry without a reasonable offset and despite being under government control, the oil company does not have to play ball. The right and reasonable thing to do is find a win win situation for everybody.
204	You'd never get an export fee through Congress, so you have no leverage for your number 1.
205	Speculators have an impact but not as much as the declining dollar.Just print some more money why dont ya........................
206	And then come back and complain about the rampant inflation...and blame Bush...
207	It sure doesn't help when our president wants the price of gas more in line with Europe's price
208	Currently, the economists have all said that the Wall St. speculators have added 50-56 cents per gallon purchased because of their bullshit.This summer, gas was at 3.20 here in Amarillo, subtract what Wall St. took in, and gas prices would have been around 2.64 to 2.70 if it wasn't for them.How much has the devaluation of the dollar driven up prices? Got a link, or are you gonna have The "T"ard parrot your bullshit again for ya?
209	However we have threads around here applauding Obama and the INCREASE of Wall Street gains attributing it to Obama...HOW do YOU explain this phenom exactly?
210	How do I explain it? Same way I explained it in 2008 when I said that the oil companies were ripping off everyone, and they posted record profits after that.Like I said, if you see the oil companies posting record profits again this summer, you're gonna know Obama didn't cause the increase.It would be helpful if you'd pay attention once in a while, but I understand............that's why you're called The "T"ard.
211	Oil companies aren't rippiing anyone off you OAF...Government makes MORE on a gallon of gas than those that produe it fuckface.
212	Hey there you turd burgling colon commando, got a link for that bullshit?
213	If I remember correctly....the oil companies only make around 10 cents a gallon on profit. There have been numerous congressional investigations to try and nail them for gouging, but for a couple of service stations gouging, they could never come up with anything.These oil companies are huge...even the small ones like Exxon. Everybody uses gas....this is why they have huge profits. Not from price gouging
214	How much profit does the average oil company make on an average gallon of gas right now? The answer will surprise you  $0.09.
215	What BULLSQUEEZE is that asswipe?[Nextime? DO your own RESEARCH]
216	Fed tax on a gallon of gas is 18.4 cents
217	Nothing in there about how much they make I see............good link, tells nothing.
218	Good link...but tells nothing? really/ Are YOU braindead?
219	Profit for the oil companies is 9 cents a gallon
220	check out the total taxes per a gallon of gas for each state in that Wiki link.
221	Damn the REP system...!
222	Maybe you could follow up your '08 treatise by rendering an opinion on why oil prices fell by $100 in a 7 month time span.Did the "speculator's bullshit" cause the crash in oil prices between June '08 to January '09?Wax on, wax off.
223	You mean.......you waited until Meister came to bail you out.I'm still serious though Meister, I'd be willing to bet that at the end of the 2nd quarter this year, oil companies will be posting record profits again.Just wait.
224	Goddamn REP system. Mr. H? Owe ya buddy.
225	*I* wait for NO ONE to baile ME out of anything...BOY.
226	Bring IT.
227	Hmm. An opinion piece which favors the President's non existent energy policy and of course the expected hall pass.Where was this when gas prices rose to $4 the first time? Nowhere. Your side blamed the Bush admin claiming both the President and the VP of deliberately sending prices higher to benefit "their rich oil company friends"...You cannot have it both ways.The fact is Obama is anti fossil fuels. His energy Secretary has been quoted many times he thinks gas prices here should be what they are in Western Europe.Obama has dismissed any ideas to allow gas prices to settle. His answer to the people is " Americans must learn to use less gasoline"...Now, the facts say that despite the liberal talking points listed above, the refining end of the oil business is very expensive here in the US. This is due to the layers of regulations and bureaucratic red tape.BTW, just because an opinion piece appears in a publication that is perceived to not be biased ot the left, does not mean the piece cannot be of a liberal viewpoint.The NY Times prints conservative viewpoints on occasion.
228	Yeah you do...........Meister posts links, you don't. Your whole basic type of posting is based on making wild ass assertions and waiting for someone else to make your point for you.I almost never see you post links.
229	They may be.....but it's because more people are using more fuel, ABS. 9 cents a gallon is 9 cents a gallon.Look at the size of these companies...and look at Exxon: Click on the pic for size
230	Call 'em. Or can't YOU fight your own battles?
231	Because you're speaking logically and The "T"ard isn't, do you have a link that verifies that oil companies make only 9 cents/gal?
232	Already flagged your post and reported it. Now, you want to talk some more smack about my mother?
233	I hardly SEE America in that graph.What a shock.
234	Rather have something other than an opinion piece. Real facts that can be verified if ya got 'em, because otherwise, I'd have to take this person's word (who doesn't really appear to be in the oil business).
235	Caviat asshole? WHY?
236	NOPE...BUT I DO wanna talk about your sorry ASS.
237	Because just like I'd rather hear from a legitimate doctor on medical issues, or would like to hear from a legitimate scientist on science issues, I'd like to hear about oil prices from someone who actually works in the business, instead of some physicist.Would you trust Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Michio Kaku to tell you why gas prices are what they are? I wouldn't.Oh yeah..........for uneducated people like you, those are 2 of the top physicists in the world.
238	Sorry, you can't change the posts, only mods can, and yeah........I've already quoted those posts when I reported them.
239	I didn't TRY to change a thing asshole.You gonna debate me or WIMP OUT?
240	Just wanted to make sure you knew.
241	*I* know more than you are willing to belive.Now? Debate or wimp out? YOU gonna cease obfuscating?
242	As I thought...WIMP Out.You haven't the stones nor I the time to trifle with an admitted wimp.I've spent an hour challanging you, and YOU dredge up shit.Had yer chance.You will have to DREAM of debating me now.
243	My father was in the oil business for 30 years, ABS. I used to hammer on him about the profits and he showed me that they made around 10 cents a gallon profit. That was 30 years ago.Like I said earlier, they have had congressional hearings on this and always walked away with nothing on the oil companies
244	Thanks for reminding the rest of us of what is behind the high gas prices.I'm sure that you posted all of this back when Bush was being blamed for the high gas prices in 2007-2008, right?Hello? Are you still here?Didn't think so. What's that I see? Skid marks?
245	I've started to ride my bike to work...it's saved me some cash. I figure by this time next year gas will be $4
246	With more supply than demand it makes complete logical sense to cut back on production at refineries. It also then makes sense to sell in whatever market there is demand to reduce inventory; hence foreign purchasers.The price of oil is not set by us oil companies, it's set by the world market based on world supply and commensurate demand and the speculators do not foresee an improvement. Instead they see a supply at risk because the largest player in the marketplace (the US) has no sensible strategy to stabilize the supply nor the demand. It instead touts substitute energy production many decades in the future, if ever, which the speculators view with no confidence.As a matter of fact the high prices in oil both crude and refined hang on that lack of confidence. Add to that the threats by Iran, a major nation in the region seeking hegemonic supremacy, threatening closure of the shipping bottleneck, combined with a failure over time to deal rationally with that nation and the speculators bid up the price of oil according to the chaos they are seeing.A new US congress and president taking office together in '13, with a believable policy announcement on US oil pruduction and a naval presence in the Persian Gulf to prevent any temporary closure would begin to settle the markets and wring the speculation out of the equation.An American president whose best solution to high domestic gasoline prices is to threaten to take away Oil Company "tax breaks," which in reality are allowances for accelerated depreciation which are meant to encourage investment in costly exploration and equipment purchased or manufactured aimed at increasing the oil supply is seen by speculators as being counter-productive to stabilizing oil and gasoline prices.Oh, and the refining capacity that is being taken off line is the least efficient available, and can't be made more efficient because of permitting requirements by the EPA.The price of oil expressed in US dollars is not helped by weak dollars because of Fed policy the past three and half years. All commodity prices show that weakness.Gasoline prices have dropped in California in the past few days for one simple and what should be a instructive reason; the switching from winter blend to summer blend - which will lower the price until elevated summer driving demand pushes it back up. This is being touted as a panacea.All across America gasohol blends are mandated that actually lower automobile gas mileage, cost more than unblended gasoline because ethanol is much more costly to produce, is federally subsidized, burns dirtier, as well as adds direct costs for the blending process itself.We have a system in chaos, with no logical controlling authority. This undermines confidence in positive expectations, exacerbates doubt, hence speculation that the situation can get worse before it gets better.
247	Quick question...................if the oil companies are only making 9 cents per gal, then why the fuck does Wall St. get 50 to 56 cents per gal?
248	Quoting yourself again I see.Must be the last refuge of the retarded.
249	The American people understand WHO AND WHY the price of gas and oil are spiking.Even the trolls on this board pretending they don't get it and trying to pin that blame on Obama, really understand it.So debating this issue with those lying trolls is a basically a pointless exercise unless you're fond of watching people make partisan asses of themselves.
250	How do I fix it? Who do you think I am?
251	Yeah. We got that. Oil is up to about 106/barrel. That's high.Fossil fuel is a world market. Do you think that this country exists in a vacuum?
252	He could campaign to start drilling in ANWR. Open up the East and West Coasts to drilling. Remove the moratorium from the Gulf. Endorse and vigorously campaign for Fracking.Stop threatening to penalize the oil companies for simply doing business. Stop attacking any company that shows a profit. Stop endorsing the selective enforcement of tax law according to which industry his doners support.The president does plenty to affect all markets by doing what he does and not doing what he doesn't. He's the president, after all.
253	Right. The POTUS has no power. Are a completely clueless and recently recovered coma victim?
254	Wow! An oil company that is run by the government. It would be the only oil company on the planet that needs a subsidy to pay the bonuses to the executive appointed by the president as political pay backs.Steven Chu runs the US Oil Company. That's a recipe for great success.
255	Under Bush, demand was way up due to t a good economy (the worst since the Great Depression) and under the Big 0 demand is way down due to the horrible economy (currently recovering from the Bush recession)Have some more Kool Aid.
256	Speculators due exactly that speculate and they take everything into consideration in order to make money so all the policies and uncertainty in the economy lead them to buy and sell - raise lower the price of oil ect so how can it not be placed on the current administration? After all its his policies and some other from before him.Im sure if cap and trade were in place it would be alot higher...Its called supply and demand so if we didnt need as much due to the fact that we have our own they would speculate down!
257	No one's willing to recognize the Federal Reserve's role in this? After the collapse in 2008 oil fell hard to $30/bbl. The Fed instituted several massive liquidity injections to buy junk MBS and reflate the economy, and then proceeded to utilize 2 separate rounds of quantitative easing. This inflated the monetary base to historic proportions and severely devalued the Dollar.Ever since that, oil has continued to climb.It's the DOLLAR.
258	Natural gas prices are at historic lows. In fact, because natural gas prices are so low, the average consumer hasn't seen a significant increase in his overall energy expenditure of late, even though gas is up.
259	I'm not the one blaming Obama, so apparently I'm one of the few who does know that around here.
260	democrats hammered BushRepublicans will hammer obamaYa reaps what ya sows ya knows?
261	To sum up the stupdity and lies by liberals on this subject...When Bush was President and the price of gas rose, Democrats like Kerry went on TV saying Bush was allowing the Saudis to limit the world supply of oil to increse their profits. Meanwhile Bush with no power over the Saudis increased domestic drilling in the USA....but was still blamed for fairy dust stories regarding middle east oil.When Obamination got into office, his EPA and Dept of the Interior goons slowed and even stopped drilling permits on Federal lands, even defying a Federal judge based in Louisiana to reopen drilling in the Gulf. His Dept of Energy idiot leader (white roads Chu) said he wanted $10/gallon gas in the USA, but then tried to cover it up at Congress hearings last week.Of course, speculators that buy and sell future crud options see Obamination and his fellow goons driving up the price of oil with their policies, so they bet on rising oil prices.....Oh, but this is alllllllllll Bush's fault.
262	I'm still waiting for someone to explain Canada. They produce more oil than they consume and yet their gas isn't any cheaper than ours. Why?
263	Uh, since they have Obamacare on steroids up there....they tax the hell out of gas and everything else.Also, the cost of getting gas to their LARGER country in isolated areas drives up the cost of gas.The British have a 60% tax rate on their gas to pay for FREE healthcare and other goodies you dumbfucks want here. What is their price of gas compared to the USA????Green goons like you have ruined England where the middle class and lower are stuck in a rut because they don't have the dispensable income after being taxed to death.
264	Canada pays considerably MORE for a gallon of gas than we do...as a result of their taxes. Since they produce more than they consume, their gas should be about the same as we pay with taxes...it isn't.So why is that? It's simple really. Gas goes on the WORLD MARKET where oil companies and speculators control what the price will be.
265	HOW MUCH?Oil was trading at 150 a barrel the last time it hit four dollars, Now it trades at around 105. You tell me what that inflation figure is. I suspect it will be greater then the speculators.
266	You admit Canada adds more in taxes to their gas at the pump.....which drives up the cost, but then you wonder why their gas is higher than our gas price.Canadian politicians and higher shipping costs add cents to dollars on their gas, so it costs more to get gas in Canada.Obamination is helping drive up the cost of gas here by preventing drilling on Federal lands. The people that buy and sell future oil sales see Obamination limiting SUPPLY, so the price goes up.Obamination is guilty of higher gas prices here just like the Canadian and English left-wing politicians are in their countries. I would not be shocked to see Obamination add more Federal taxes on gas to drive up the cost more so he can prevent Joe Schmoe from driving a car. He is a socialist elitist that believes he should only have a vehicle while the rest of you lemmings need to ride a bus, walk or ride a bike like in USSR.I will not respond to your robo responses that are mindless bullshit anymore. You just repeat the same shit over and over and over without addressing reality and the facts.
267	Canada pays considerably MORE than we do...as a result of their taxes. Without their taxes, they'd be paying about what we do. How is that possible when they produce more than they consume?
268	Got to love all the silly liberals, they still claim that high gas prices were Bush's fault, yet today's high gas prices are not Obama's fault.It doesn't matter whose fault it is, if they are high in November and the economy starts to fall again because of the high fuel costs, Obama will take a big hit with the voters.
269	No actually we didn't. As one of the "silly libs" you are talking about, I always blamed the oil companies and speculators for the price of gas. If you look at polls from that time, most people DID NOT blame Bush.Granted, more people blamed Bush than they blame Obama now, (but not by a large margin 25% to 18%) but that might have something to do with the fact that Bush was an oil man that started an unnecessary war in oil country...and was photographed kissing Saudi Oil princes.
270	Because they prefer to sell it as a "global" commodity.They don't have to do that, but it's about the money.But.....the price of gas in Saudi Arabia is less than a dollar and in Iran it's just a little more expensive than S.A. But their oil company is run by the government.If we drilled and produced we wouldn't have to tie it to the "global commodity", but we would because our oil companies are privately owned
271	Exactly. Thanks for proving my point.
272	I wasn't too stupid to click on the link and read the honest assessment that the big spike in gasoline prices in the Bush administration was due to Katrina and most of the Gulf rigs being closed down for inspection and/or repairs. By the end of the Bush administration, after those rigs came back on line, gas prices had returned to tolerable levels.What the blogger didn't say however is that President Bush had a hostile media who buried the real reasons for negative indicators and left the public with the impression that it was the President's fault. They would put some Democrat's criticism of the President near the top of the story for instance, and tack on a headline that "The Bush Administration Comes Under Increasing Criticism" or some such as that.The media can and does absolutely influence public perception in all who don't read much below the headlines or who do get most of their news from leftwing blogs or 30 second soundbites. And as more and more of America is dumbed down in an inferior education system, the more power the media has.They don't do that to Obama. The mostly Obama friendly media points to every possible indicator OTHER than President Obama's policies for the reason for high gas prices. At least in the first paragraphs in the newspaper or in the lead in on the evening television news. Headlines are more likely to reflect a President who is concerned rather than policies that are at least partially to blame.The blogger also said that even though the perception is that it isn't Obama's fault now, it couldl be a problem for him if gas prices remain high at the time of the 2012 election.
273	We've had the warmest winter in decades. Demand and price of Natural Gas are both down.We've set records for warm days that stood since the 1800's.Makes you wonder what cooled the climate so dramatically since then, doesn't it?
274	It's not like it's all his fault or not his fault at all.He can be a huge part of the problem or a huge part of the cause compared to the average person. From his record, I'd lean toward the part of the cause.
275	Didn't you already respond to this yourself?
276	Given the implications, I'd rather see him kiss then bow.
277	First..Stop the "wall street" buzz word nonsense.To answer you question. Traders are "getting" 50 cents per gallon. I have no idea what that means anyway. Probably some interpretation by biased members of the media.The story goes that commodities trading accounts for roughly 50 cents per gallon of gasoline. I would imagine this means at the retail level. Where this alleged data originated is a mystery.Actually retailers make more like 2-3 cents per gallon on regular. Of course the margins for mid grade and premium are higher. Retailers sell much less of these two products.Now, the reason margins are so low for regular....Most gas is sold at convenience stores. One store owner who I got to know very well showed me his invoices during a conversation we were having about gas prices. His retail price was just 2 cents above his cost. Why? In his words he said the only reason he sold gas was to get people to come into the store to purchase items. His markups for merchandise were 50 to 100%.If one really wants to find a culprit for high gas prices they can look right to government.For example. Here in NC we pay a whopping 39.5 cents per gallon fuel tax, then sales tax then the 18 cents per gallon federal tax.Roughly 70 cents per gallon goes to government in the form of tax.I am not implying gasoline should not be taxed. However, when the gas tax is supposed to go to roads new and existing, it gets mighty frustrating when the politicians tell us there is a shortage of money for road projects BTW 39.5 cents per gallon is one the highest gas taxes in the US.
278	And paying record dividends to owners of stock.It is almost impossible to have a 401k or mutual fund and not benefit from dividends paid by oil companies.However, I would like to point out the fallacy of your "record profits" statement. Oil companies actually have a very low profit margin when compared to many business' and other industries. For example, Apple has a profit margin of 28.2%, whereas Exxon has a profit margin of 9.47%. Apple is almost 3 times as much, yet I see all kinds of threads bitching about oil company profits and almost none bitching about Apple's profits.
279	.... this morning (probably much-more preferable, for Teabaggers ; no reading, required), regarding what prompts higher-prices !!!!
280	And the last I heard, Venezuela was selliing gasoline to its own people for like 25 cents a gallon or something like that. Of course the oil they sell to us is considerably more than it costs to produce a barrel of our own oil.
281	Which is irrational.
282	Ah, yes.....let's talk percentages, rather than those.....
283	Gee instead of but but but Bush, it's now but but but the GOP. lol
284	In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits.How do hedge fund managers make the price of gas go up?Could some ignorant liberal explain it to me? Thanks!
285	If oil traders and various other financial institutions are bullish on the price of gas they will buy up gas futures contracts; the demand for the contracts pushes up their prices.They might, for example, want to be heavily long in oil and gas in anticipation of some sort of blow up in Iran.
286	Yes, their demand for contracts pushes up the value of the contracts.So how does that push up the price of gas?The financial institution doesn't take delivery of the gas.They don't consume the gas.So how do they raise the price?
287	Crude oil prices are a futures game. People invest and drive up the price because they assume that oil prices will go up. What would cause them to believe that oil prices will go up under the Obama administration? Look around you boobs.
288	You're not going to explain?
289	Libs don't want to be questioned, you are supposed to take their word for it.
290	So is orange juice, hog bellies, cotton, coffee, wheat, corn and hundreds of other things.I find it funny that some people are only concerned about oil (or energy) futures.
291	Too many people need to watch "Trading Places".
292	Too many people need to watch "Trading Places".The future price of a 'Trading Places' DVD just went up.
293	Speculators can't drive up oil prices unless they have the means to store the oil outside of the commodities market. Inventories are below expectations  the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index is low which means speculators are not renting oil tankers to store oil off-shore. There is a supply problem brought on by government!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
294	Five dollars... I think I'll go to the movies. By myself!
295	Nobody is betting on an Israeli attack on Iran driving up the price of orange juice.
296	They aren't betting on a harsh Florida winter to do it either, but it happens. (Oh, and fungicide in south america changes US orange juice consumption also, who knew?)Edit to add:There are lots of ways different events can cause commodity prices to swing one way or another. Speculators just react to those events. It's no different than how before the year 2000 hit, many people purchased some extra gasoline 'just in case' and kept it in their garage or shed. They were speculating.
297	Not so; although in a commodity futures contract the purchaser promises to take possession at some fixed future date, the purchaser may instead sell that contract and never take actual possession. Speculators purchasing options do not promise to take physical possession of the commodity, in this case oil. They may choose to or they may simply sell the option and reap the profit or the loss making that decision at the options exercise date, and the demand they create in the market can and does drive up prices.
298	We export GAS, we import OIL.China's car sales are up 30% year over year in February. That's where excess supply is going.
299	That's a red herring. We don't import gasoline, but of course we do export it so it goes without saying that we'd export more than we import (zero). It's a comparison that goes without saying, and is made for the confusion it sows.Furthermore it's a world market, and we sell to it. The only way that could be precluded would be to nationalize the oil companies.There is oil in S. Texas (the Gulf) that cannot be piped east because of a pipeline bottleneck, and the price is lower than the world market because of the glut there. It makes perfect sense that they would refine it and sell it at a premium, and part of that refined product would be exported, since they can't sell it profitably (glut) in their own region.It's not driving up the price of gasoline elsewhere, and it is applies favorably to lower the US trade deficit.
300	Certainly not pork bellies.
301	Not quite. Anyone who can pass some silly litmus literacy test for the commodity exchange (in any case, anyone), can also buy and sell the actual future of a product, with a promise to accept shipment or deliver. They can also sell that contract on the open market. As it stands today, only 1/3 of the actual futures contracts on oil, are between people who can actually deliver or accept a commodity. The other 2/3rds are just gambling.
302	Sorry but I must disagree; it is Obama's fault!
303	The commodity futures contract still represents physical oil. That oil is still delivered from the supplier to the consumer. If investment banks took delivery  resold/rolled over that oil it would increase the amount of supply driving down the price. The physical oil has to be stored somewhere (preferably hidden from inventory) in order to drive up prices. Last time they keep the oil on a bunch of tankers out in the ocean where it did not show up in inventory.WHERE ARE THE OIL THE SPECULATORS HOLDING ALL THAT OIL???? Inquiring minds would like to know.
304	Without letting the manipulators off the hook, they are able to do what they are doing only because the supply/demand ratio of oil has gotten worse. Otherwise, there would be no room for it.This is not unlike the OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s, whose immediate cause was political manipulation by an oil cartel many of whose members were pissed off by the Yom Kippur War. But OPEC would not have been able to pull that off except that the U.S. hit its national oil peak in 1970 and, after that, became dependent on oil imports.I'm not saying that speculation and profiteering aren't factors making the situation worse, but the geological and global-economic reality is that the era of cheap oil is over, and it's never coming back.
305	Exxon-Mobil's CEO, Rex Tillerson only knows what his cost of supply is. Exxon-Mobil only makes up a small slice of the oil market. Why is he not supplying all the oil the market needs to make enormous profits at $126 Brent Crude World Price? - Someone is limiting his supply capacity.
306	Interesting observation. During the so called "Arab oil embargo" vs the US, the news media shot film of tankers parked off the NJ/NY coast waiting to be unloaded. Until then, we Americans were told there was a severe shortage. The scam was that while we were told ot conserve gasoline, that brought into play the term "allocation". So as we did our civic duty and slashed our consumption of fuel, the so called allocation was reduced in proportion to fuel used. WTF?!!!! Use less, receive less. Nice going. As a result, we were introduced ot the term 'stagflation'....The eocnomy was at a standstill while consumer prices continued to rise.As I recall, soon after the parked tanker scam was uncovered, the 'embargo' was lifted. Gas prices tumbled.
307	.Tillereson told Cantwell exactly what she needed to hear. The end game is 'blame someone else'.Newsflash...If there were no market to trade commodities, the prices for them would have to fixed by a group or entity placed in charge of this.Are you sure you desire to see price fixing beome the procedure?
308	To stop Wall Street from playing hardball with your hard-earned money, we should enact a 70 percent tax on profits from oil speculator transactions. Note, this is not a tax on oil itself or even on oil companies. It is a tax on speculative profits made on Wall Street trading desks.What is an " oil speculator transaction"?
309	You reckon it will make them think a bit?
310	No, not even a little.
311	When you have lots of other people's cash, I guess one could care less...Free market on the way out?
312	Will the government pay me 70% on all my losses?
313	No kidding.I bet I could come up with 5 ways to show a profit on crude and a loss on the "oil speculator transaction". I'll be rich!
314	Poor Dems, blamed Bush, now it is biting them in the ass, when Obama is blamed.lol!Dems are so hypocritical.I'm sitting back and enjoying the show and all the blame they are spewing so their beloved leader doesn't get the blame. Have we heard Pelosi on this?Lol!
315	Do American Conservatives and Libertarians adore dictatorships, totalitarianism?
316	This post was written by Dante.
317	This post was written on 2012-03-12T10:57:00.
318	We had the great Conservative hero, the late Senator Jesse Helms with his unbridled support of the regimes: Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, South Africa (the apartheid gov)......to be continued...
319	No, we don't like Obama.
320	Does it look like we are supporting the President?
321	I predict denial at flood stage in this thread.
322	ya think?USMB libertarian/cons take a ride on the African Queen?
323	All Barry needs is one of those funny little totalitarian mustaches for full effect.
324	you mean like this:
325	looks like the Nile is at flood stage
326	You are projecting, Dante.Do you think the Leftist totalitarianism push we are experiencing this is anything new?Is Obama the first smooth talking populist that worked the common man into a lather to believe the bad rich people were controlling all of 'our wealth'?This disaster has been repeated MANY times throughout history, and always ends badly.
327	Let's see.Conservatives supported the Contras, which engaged in large numbers of human rights violations, including outright murder through what became known as death squads.Then there was the conservative support to the racist Apartheid regime of South Africa.And who can forget the Heritage Foundation's and Grover Norquist's support for Joseph Savimbi and UNITA in Angola?
328	Are you normally this incredibly stupid, or is this just a moment you're having?Citing one poster on USMB as the end all in conservative/libertarian views has got to be the biggest reach I've seen in a while.Libertarians are about as close to classical liberalism as it gets today. the left wing "progressive" liberals are nothing short of full blown communist totalitarians. Like Obama.And there are no true conservatives left on the right except the social conservative kind. Which is not what conservatism is about.
329	In the end, lousy troll thread. F -
330	wow! you underwhelm with your vast knowledge of how to use propaganda. do you have nazi envy?
331	only the OP mentions more than just one member's post, and says to be continued.gawd, if you're gonna deflect and distort, at least take: D and D 101 - @ USMB Universitynote: USMB University is fully accredited with
332	In other words, it is not a moment. Got it.i didn't deflect. I answered your ridiculous charges. And, they are just that, ridiculous.
333	For the most part no, I don't think so.Not so for the rightie-nutters on this board howver......
334	Are you fucking kidding me?You don't see libertarians advocating for more laws, regulations and bigger government do you? NO you don't dummy.Meanwhile progressives do nothing BUT advocate more laws, more legislation and bigger government..Who are the authoritarians again????Once again progressives are delusional....
335	Maybe lefties think Stalin was a libertarian or conservative. Anything is possible with the union based education system these days. After all FDR called him "uncle Joe".
336	critical thinking skills lacking?read the thread starter
337	No, only Socialist/Progressive  Neocon Globalists do. Adoring Dictatorships  Totalitarianism is what they're all about. Real Conservatives are not Big Government Globalists.
338	yes. Libertarians are arguing for laws that legalize pot sales and they argue that the government can make more tax revenue...read and try to comprehend what you have commented on. your post makes for a case of denial, as it contains the original post that you fail to address.
339	Oh shut the fuck up, you don't know jack shit.Only an ignorant person would attempt to compare libertarians to totalitarianism...Such a comparison is literally ignorant, and now you want to talk about critical thinking skills???
340	Yup.
341	No, they argue that there SHOULDN'T BE LAWS PROHIBITING THE USE OF DRUGS.. As in there are already laws on the books that have been legislated by tyrants....Drugs were legal until Woodrow Wilson (a fucking tyrant) thought HE WAS A DICTATOR and started outlawing shit...You see how that works dummy???As it is the government is regulating what substances people can and cannot use and that goes against libertarian beliefs -- you know -- because libertarians are REAL LIBERALS unlike authoritarian progressives who believe the government SHOULD CONTROL WHAT SUBSTANCES AN INDIVIDUAL CAN INGEST....So once again its the authoritarian tyrants (neocons, RINO's and progressives) who are the tyrants....
342	It's impossible for true Constitutional Conservatism to lead to Dictatorships  Totalitarianism. It just can't happen. Only Big Government Globalists like Socialists/Progressives  Neocans can take you there.
343	Dr. Paul has advocated the legalization of Marijuana but he has never advocated Taxing it. Some Libertarians may have, but i know Dr. Paul hasn't.
344	Tell us who signed the NDAA  who killed Kenneth Michael Trentadue. They will be the same a-holes who love dictatorships, totalitarianism  tyranny
345	Bingo!
346	There shouldn't be a law in the first place.It was the authoritarian tyrannical government that manifested the law in the first place..Libertarians aren't advocating for the legalization of drugs, they're advocating for the repeal of present laws that outlaw drugs.Reason: The government has no right telling individuals what they can do to their own body...
347	You cant legalize a substance that was previously legal. You can repeal the law or decriminalize the act.Prohibition is a perfect example of that..
348	Wow, are you trying to see how fail a thread you can start, Dante?
349	there's that word!!!) nervous breakdown
350	Of course libertarians are pissed off, you progressives are destroying - ding ding ding - LIBERTY...You know as in the root word of libertarian???Yes libertarians are fed up with all your pussy laws and regulations and the notion the government has the right to regulate an individual..The real authoritarians are you progressives....You don't see me telling a person what they can and cannot do - you progressives are doing just that.. Even to the point of having government dictate what foods a person can and cannot eat..
351	Then you have Obamafuck telling businesses what they have to do???People and businesses don't have to do anything they don't want to do - that is the beauty of classical liberalism - you're free to do what you want...Progressives don't believe that.....They believe government knows best and it is up to government to make every decision in our lives for us...
352	What about the Liberals and Progressives that admire Chavez and Castro?
353	What a load of shit. You people are the statists here. You can't even put together a case. All you've done is appeal to feelings. There is no logic in your post at all.
354	Of course you do. Now get some glasses, Mr. Magoo.
355	while Ron Paul forums and other moronic sites speak in gobblygook about state rights on taxes...there exists Nationally, a bill that would allow states to legalize and regulate marijuana sales is sponsored by two men who can be considered bookends of the U.S. House of Representatives  conservative/libertarian Republican Rep. Ron Paul, and liberal Democratic Rep. Barney Frank.regulate sales is code for taxing - consumer taxes
356	Lets say their dogma is predicated on authoritarianism  conservatives have an intense need to compel others to conform, they detest diversity and dissent, and as reactionaries long for an idealized American past that never really existed in the first place.They dont intentionally adore dictatorships, but share many similar traits, however inadvertent.To wit:Oh shut the fuck up, you don't know jack shit.
357	You have gotten your ass handed to you by about 5 posters.LOL
358	Don't you know? We are going to oppress and control people by allowing them to be free to do as they choose.
359	Telling people they have to buy things isn't authoritarian? Can you explain that?
360	All Barry needs is one of those funny little totalitarian mustaches for full effect.you mean like this:*****************************************Like Stalin, Mao, Mussolini and Amin?
361	you mean like this:
362	No. And it's a stupid proposition to suggest that we do.Now STATISTS on the other hand love them some dictator.
363	oh, the distinctions that more often than not exist on paper only
364	My dearest Imbecilic Idiot, please refrain from lecturing. You do it so poorly.Progressives and populists are high on my list of next-in-line-4-cattle-cars after conservative nitwits who tend towards Randian Nitwitticy
365	No liberal admires a dictator. Progressives, conservatives and others do and have.
366	No. The distinctions that really do exist and which you choose to falsely deny.
367	dD
368	Oh go fuck off...Truth is I could survive without government and you couldn't..Ever hear of natural selection?
369	dopey and moronic,
370	The deal is, you don't make the ideal the enemy of the good. If you have to choose between the very bad and the horrible, you go for the lesser evil.That does not mean the lesser evil is the goal and you support it contrary to all sense. Though one can argue we have done that mistake.One of the failures of US Foreign policy has been to assume that we are stuck with Hobson's choice. That is not always the case. We may just need to recognize there are more options.Liberals like to treat each case as if it had no relation to what is going on around it. You either support or oppose this moderately bad with no recognition of what the alternatives are or what the surrounding circumstances are.There is more to Foreign affairs than just one question in one place. A lot of times when you flip one counter, lots of other counters around it also flip in ways that can cause greater problems than leaving well enough alone
371	You offer that quote as though them saying such tripe somehow makes it "right."The fact of the matter is, they are full of shit.The Republican Party isn't the engine of change. The Republican Party is part of the problem.The engine of change lies in the awakening many of us are having over how badly off-course we are.I keep reading the propaganda of the day which seeks to "define" who and what conservatives are. But it's malarkey.Conservatives don't seek the status quo. Why would we wish to keep things the "way they are" when the way things are are so fucked up, due to incremental liberal changes, that we have ended up in a very bad place?Conservatives, properly understood, seek to put things BACK to the way they are SUPPOSED TO BE.Pontificators can label that effort "ideologically extreme, contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime, scornful of compromise, unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition." In fact, that's got some truth in it.If looking to correct our course is considered ideologically extreme, then count me in. If it constitutes being "contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime," then yeah, that's me. I AM contemptuous of the notion that because this is where we've landed, we are obligated to STAY HERE. That's ridiculous. HERE is not a good place. We are in danger of crumbling. We DO in fact need to move. I AM contemptuous of the silly modern American liberalism that takes us here and seeks to move us even further away from where we should be. I DO scorn "compromise" which serves only to solidify the invalid "gains" of the left over these many recent years. You bet your ASS that I am "unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science [sic]," when those "fats" aren't real facts, the evidence has gotten deliberately distorted and the science is fiction. And no. The political opposition is not "legitimate" exactly to the extent that they rebuff the strictures of the Constitutionally imposed limits on government authority and power.
372	Words like progressive, liberal, conservative, libertarian authoritarian, and totalitarian are too difficult for many to rationalize.Our union based education system does a great job...This is why progressives call themselves "liberals" and believe it too.Of course little olde me is in the corner laughing and pointing fingers....
373	I guess you get to tell people they aren't liberals now.
374	Liberals are conservative totalitarians really just "authoritarians?"Oh it is just a joke... I'm a comedian that is why I can say that Nancy Pelosi is a whore, or a riddle...
375	I can and do because I own a Websters Dictionary...
376	Do it all the time you idiot.
377	I have a dictionary that actually defines antisemitism as being against those of semetic/arabic descent.It is hard to revise the print like they do the online dictionaries.
378	Nicky has a dictionary? Could have fooled me.
379	There aint much that couldn't fool you, though.
380	Can someone please tell me how you can be for eliminating laws in the lives of people and be a totalitarian?
381	Tell me something, using that definition, which party seems more liberal to you, the Democrats or the Republicans?
382	I do, but I am a self righteous jerk, just ask yourself if you don't believe me.
383	The same way you can be for laws that require people to do things for their own good and not be one.
384	Did you not just a few posts back describe Barney Frank as a Liberal Democrat? Do you not consider Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and Jimmy Carter to be Liberals because they have each said they admire Castro.I've been posting here for a few weeks now and in that time you've probably started as many topics and made as many posts as anyone here, yet you haven't once made a factually accurate statement. Whether it's your simply inaccurate statements like your mis-understanding of political labels and the views associated with them, to your childish name-calling or even your sad attempts at humor each has been a failure.Following the examples of blind squirrels and broken clocks it would almost seem this would have to be intentional on your part. This seems to lead to only 2 possible scenarios so I'm curious are you so desperate for attention that you would come on here day after day and start topic after topic, make post after post, knowing each to be moronic or is it that you truly are this much of a buffoon and really don't know it.
385	you fooled me. I thought you were a real tough guy.
386	"A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and evidence tell me it is not."Maybe your heart tells you one thing and facts and evidence show what a douche you are?
387	what exactly did the progressives you mentioned say they admire about Castro? context is everything when dealing with blowhards like you.and Barney Frank is the only one above I'd call a liberal...the others being mostly progressives. Especially Carter, Carter and The Lion of Liberalism had a battle for the soul of the party in 1980.
388	and whom did Reagan trade arms to in violation of American law?November 13, 1986 -- in his first public statement about the allegations of secret arms-for-hostages negotiations with Iran"In spite of the wildly speculative and false stories of arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not -- repeat did not -- trade weapons or anything else for hostages nor will we."March 3, 1987 -- from a televised address in which he admitted to the findings of the Tower Commission"A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and evidence tell me it is not."huh?
389	Or maybe you dont have a real answer so you're avoiding the question.
390	Ronald Reagan makes the above comments and people consider him honest, full of integrity and a role model?

402	!
403	A heavy campaign of guilt by association and character assassination was already well underway, what does she think would be different? They did not have a chance no matter what they would have done with her on the ticket.
404	Yep, that is why he (Schmidt) is out to destroy her...she wouldn't bow down to him..She'll survive..
405	awwwwwwwww... cute... a hack thread.they dealt with that issue in the flim.what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.and it's not like the tweeting twit who said there are "pro america parts of the country" would have looked any smarter if she brought McCain into the slime and mud.
406	but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.__________________Who made an error: PALIN.
407	No surprise there. We lost the day he became the nominee. He should have stuck at what he did best, crash perfectly good Jets.
408	Actually when she was picked and started to attack Obama, she boosted McCain's poll numbers and they led for awhile until he suspended his campaign despite her objection.
409	LOL, a racist campaign...by investigating Obama's PAST..I never took you for someone who would just believe everything you saw in some MOVIE
410	Palin did absolutely nothing during the campaign that was racist.
411	McCain wouldn't let her. You're the one who started this thread. Youi should know the details before doing so.
412	you already know his past. so what are you babbling about?it wasn't slimy enough for you?
413	Yeah, the economy just tanked, and Palin's idea of offering an agenda of hope for tomorrow is to try to dig up dirt about the past? Sounds like talk radio.
414	So, was it RACIST to dig up Newt Gingrich's 20 year old divorce papers (from his PAST) and have CNN realseae them?dear gawd jilly.
415	Palin was a liability to the McCain campaign every time she opened her mouth.
416	What do you expect from a man that is all too readily willing to reach across the aisle to the left to set up Conservatives for a good drubbing from them?And he repeats the same shit...and is called a "Maverick" by the leftist media. (There a clue here)...and then goes back to Arizona for re-election parading around saying he's 'Conservative'...gets re-elected, and goes back to old habits.I admire his military service and what he endured...him as a politician...is where it ends.
417	really?was it racist when they dug up Bush's papers from the military (from his PAST) and tried to say he was AWOL?come on jilly, lets talk, slime
418	And it was all untrue about GW Bushs' service. Ask Dan Blather about it as he lost his job over it.
419	McCain made her a liability as she was upstaging him. He would have no part of it as he muzzled her.
420	she'll be back..
421	Sure she will. She's in effect back now speaking but not running...expect more of rabid leftist attempts to discredit her so she won't run.(The point all-along, don't you think)?
422	And you would be correct my friend. I actually worked on the campaign. We started receiving texts or emails not to say anything negative regarding to his possible religion or even mention his middle name or church. We were not allowed to do any of that in the districts I was in. I think the media was reporting 80% negative stories on McCain compared to about 25% negative stories on Obama. It was lopsided in the positive media coverage when it came to favor-ability for Obama. Anything deemed negative a campaign staffer allegedly would say, the media would label the whole campaign racist. Even McCain was so sensitive he even apologized for radio host Billy Cunnigham for mentioning Obama's middle name at a McCain rally prior to McCain taking the stage. You're right, McCain didn't want Palin to upstage him and her campaign stops received 30% more people than he.
423	I was watching the campaign vehemently...I could tell something was internally wrong.Any wonder why McCain lost?
424	For fucks sake this shit is ooooooold.Get with the times or stfu.
425	Old...but lessons ignored that must be retaught my friend...
426	While serving our country in Viet Nam. And paying for it with some time in the Hanoi Hilton.Classy. You and Tommy (who thanked you for your shot at a Nam Vet). Classy. Let me guess, you are a Rightie.
427	The lesson to be learned here is that wallowing in self pity is not a good thing. We lost the election. Move on. Everytime the left brings up Bush or Palin were all over them. What's good for the goose.......Besides we have enough rdean radical types already.
428	All of this information about Obama's radical connections have been known since 2008. These facts have been hiding in plain sight all along.The media has failed to report it, and the media has failed or more accurately refused to demand proof of Obama's identity and eligibility. It still refuses to do so. Sheriff Joe Arpaio's investigation has proven his birth certificate to be a forgery along with his selective service card. That's just the preliminary findings. The media should be abolished for their failure to report this. As the Sheriff said this morning in a interview, "This is 10 times bigger than Watergate".
429	Palin was a liability to the McCain campaign every time she opened her mouth.************************************************** *****This isn't her first attempt to get more media attention by attacking McCain.
430	Rev. Wright wasn't mentioned in the 2008 campaign?
431	She'e not attacking McCain. She's attacking the campaign managers.
432	He was. Something about the wheels of the bus running him over after 20 years,.
433	And it's 10 times bigger than the 400+ sex crime cases, most against children, that Sheriff Joe was to busy to investigate.
434	Legitimate link and I WILL RAG ON HIM RIGHT NOW.
435	Investigating Obama's past is racist?My gawd you're stupid.
436	Aside from the jurisdictional question, and his interest in birth certificates, Arpaio has a few legal problems of his own.
437	Do you realize that what Rev Wright said is preached in 95% of the black churches in America. Those 20 years are what validate Obama to the black community. Before that Hillary had about 65% of the black vote.
438	the black pastor who screamed "God damn America it's in da bible" that black pastor.. would you show us where in da bible it says "God Damn America"we'll wait. McCain may be a decent guy but that black pastor surely isn't.. oh and that black pastor and his buddy Farakkam.. you know how they feel about the Jews don't you? and still you kiss their butts and defend them? most darn puzzling to me. are you lying to us about being Jewish?
439	Oops it was 532 cases.
440	I believe it. Every time obama says "God Bless America" I know what he's really saying.
441	THEN PROMPTLY THREW HIM UNDER THE BUS.How does that validation work?
442	he's like that video they hid til after the election.. he's a regular visitor at the wh now.
443	I find it puzzling, but then the black community supported the corruption In Detroit from Father to son.Why they lack any decency standards in politics is something I will never understand.
444	He's in the white house isn't he?You have to break some eggs to make an omelet.
445	While Obama and his psychophants Break this Republic...
446	Richard Nixon, Bob Ney, Duke Cunningham, Spiro Agnew, Fife Simington, Evan Mecham, George Ryan, etc.Blacks?
447	Your republic maybe, but not mine.
448	Correct.The OP acts as if had only the McCain campaign been allowed to go negative they might have won the election.
449	YOU are free to leave. *I* will pay for you to go wherever you like...ONE WAY TICKET.
450	Yes he is. Does the black community have any standards that they can be truly proud of. See my remarks on my home town.
451	Why leave, we are shaping the country the way we want it.
452	By any means necessary.
453	So the real reply is NO.Is that correct.
454	Waiting Full-Auto
455	YOU...will lose.
456	I gave you the political standard I'm proud of.For every negative thing you can say about blacks I can find more whites doing the same thing, so bring it on.
457	We've already won. Look at your youth.
458	And you may Leave MY Republic...don't let the door break your ass as it slams shut on your way out.
459	Didnt see it. Standby
460	There is a difference between "investigation" and "making shit up".In case the right doesn't understand, here's an example.Evolution comes from "investigation".Magical Creation is "making shit up".
461	Wow the right still is hanging on Palins every word even after finding out she was a know nothing who was a just a good actress. The denial cup runeth over
462	I rest my case of the left.You haven't seen a fight yet sport. Trust me on this one.We will rid you off this land as we did the British.
463	LOL We have a much longer history slam them, I dont get defensive or butt hurt like you.
464	I should rip on you for lying. But on the bright side the cases were reopened.
465	"We did the British".Yet you claim no responsibility for America's chattel slavery of blacks.Priceless.
466	Blacks selling blacks..What was the term oh yeah priceless.
467	Who sold the Irish into slavery?P.S. Ask Tinydancer.
468	The Founders made it possible for slavery to end...ever heard of the 3/5ths Compromise?Ever wonder what sparked the Civil war?The Founders KNEW the subject of slavery would have to be addressed sooner or later. They comprommised to get the Constitution ratified in the Continental Congress.Your remarks exibit your abject ignorence as to history.
469	That's your news these days from the alphabet show.BTW Schmidt made it mandatory that no one NO ONE was to talk about Obama in a negative way.We had this dude in our sights. McCain let him. I hate John with a passion now. He let them rip Sarah.I really really hate him.We could have taken out Obama lickety split with all the shit we had on him. No. Not with McCain holier than thou piece of crap. Meghan hated Sarah and really worked on leaking everything she could.What a bitch.
470	I tell truth every time. Cromwell. He really hated catholics.
471	You are correct about Megan. She hated Bristol Palin with a passion as well as Sarah. As soon as the election was over she went on Megyn Kelly to trash Palin.
472	As Stevie Ray would say......one bourbon one scotch one beer baby line em up!!!!
473	The "entitled ones". You bet.
474	Dont know, nor care.You havent presented a single argument that I could not defeat.I can not defeat your 150 yr old butt hurt though, thats on you.
475	Cromwell was white, so that means Irish slavery wasn't that bad.
476	"Pallin' around with terrorists".You tell more lies than Yidnar. You claim to know the facts, but the facts you know don't exist.
477	For crying out loud at least go "wink wink nudge nudge say no more and give me a You gotta go girl....."Just one nod up on racking points against these fools......On the other hand stay quiet....they'll never know...
478	I thought the Civil War was about "state's right's?Hahahaha.You need to stop reading the "history" of that quack David Barton.
479	Now 'm having a laugh with this, but does anyone else remember Cromwell or am I doomed to history's chick a baby moment?
480	Do you think Bill Ayers was a terrorist?
481	Anytime your ready to have it out. We can debate your quackery.
482	No. But Robert E Lee was.
483	Like any war it was different things to different people.
484	Really? Then I suppose you're next to tell us that George Washington was as well...right?
485	I think Dole's campaign was sabotaged in the same way.During the 96' campaign Bob Dole was advised not to be funny, be serious. Bob Dole was a funny motherfucker, but his campaign advised him to stay serious.After Dole lost the election he a Clinton went around the country and even showed up in Somalia. Dole busted everyone up. Clinton was 2 hours late. By the time he arrived everyone was pissed.
486	I don't even look at a "beast of burden". The good lord doesn't teach us this way. Not at all.
487	Yep.To the British.
488	You FAILED to address the post. No matter. You're ignorant.Expected.Congrats for meeting MY expectations of you.
489	Hahahaha.If I see you walking down the street, grab you and chop off your foot should I get "credit" if I drive you to the hospital?
490	I've yet to figure what they are trying to do. I can't for the life of me. It's beyond strange.
491	Do it then or shut up.
492	Who's "they"?
493	How insane are you?Her husband is First Nations you idiot.
494	It's just best to call them on it and watch them squirm.
495	1/8th. Does that make him Indian?
496	Statist IDIOTS like YOU.Feel better someone explained it to you?IDIOT.
497	Who's squirming? You greatly overestimate your importance.
498	What tribe, and you will find your answer.
499	Many historians I have read say the War Between the States was more about agriculture vs. industrialization. I did read one who wrote that the Civil war was Lee, Grant, Lincoln, etc. "killing off the forefathers". I had a tough time writing about that theory.
500	I'm not a statist. I'm a black radical socialist veteran.
501	No one could investigate Obama's past without being called a RACIST--and I am certain that was what it was all about.Still today--NO ONE can criticize Obama's policies without being called a racist. You gripe about gas prices--you're a racist--you bring up Obama's economy--you're a racist--you bring up run away government spending--you're a racist, etc. etc. etc.
502	Yup'ik. And?
503	yep..and I'm beginning to think that is why they ran him for President..the man had no experience for it.
504	I can see very clearly I have given you too much credit on your education.Sad really, have a good day.
505	You don't even know what I'm talking about do you? You don't have a fucking clue. You're playing a game that you don't even know how to play kid.Oh my good Lord, you really don't.When that cunt Bernie wife of Billy Ayers said "stick a fork in her" she was referring to Sharon Tate.9 months pregnant Sharon Tate The bitches not only killed Polanski's wife they stabbed the baby to death in her body.That's who Bernie was referring to. Bernie was thrilled to death that Tate was not only killed but that the evil bastards stabbed her repeatedly in her abdomen.That's Bill Ayer's wife. Want me to go on?
506	And, Obama's "past" has been INVESTIGATED to the point of absurdity.
507	Whom are YOU tellin to shut up, BOY?Tell ME to shut up? Please?
508	Here's the reason as stated by the VP of the Confederacy:"But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other-though last, not least: the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. "
509	Todd's proud of his heritage. As he should be.
510	Has it? And tell us WHY he has his records under lock and key?
511	Really?You know what's sad?Todd Palin is Native American in the right-winger's eyes, because he's 1/8th Yup'ik, yet President Obama's 1/2 African blood doesn't make him black.Priceless.
512	Here we go with YOU and this RACE bullsqueeze. Just can't help yourself can you? And to think yesterday? You said you weren't?*LIAR*
513	Go on.P.S. Is saying that a crime?
514	No, it makes him a British Subject and not eligible for the presidency or Article 2 Section 1. Read the last sentence from a paragraph from his campaign website Fight the Smears."When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom’s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.‘s children.
515	Boy?Hahahaha.Shut the fuck up.
516	As anyone should be...but he isn't forcing it upon a soul...
517	Anytime...Anywhere.Debate. Me...YOU...Name it.
518	The McCain's were best freinds with Margaret Sanger and supported her cause Planned Parenthood.
519	I am sure Fox will investigate Obama's shady past. Please post when you finally figure it out.Damn people are dumb.
520	Read post #92.You dumbfucks can't even follow the thread.
521	I hope they do...CNN investigated Newt Gingrich's divorce from 20 years ago..I guess they thought that was shady
522	So your intellectual debating skills start with you calling a black man a "boy"?You are the perfect republican. You really are.
523	Now.
524	No, Sheriff Joe Arpaio is and found that his documents are forged, namely the Selective Service Card and his Abstract Long Form Birth Certificate he released back on April 27 of 2011.Take a listen to the factual credible compelling evidence released by the detectives the other day:
525	So? What others think isnt important in that situation. The tribe has the final say.Try to be relevant.
526	He can't.
527	He's not 1/8 to me you see. He's Todd. I have many friends like this.
528	Bring it.
529	Who has the final say on the blackness of President Obama?
530	He is suffering from the Obama Burn. It will only get worse and extremely vile as the months progress. This will happen to many here.
531	Topic:The Ultrasonic Method of Nondestructive testing.You can start.
532	Are you thrilled Bernie said it?
533	Yet in post #92 you brought up the ethnicity of "He's Todd" to validate Sarah Palin.
534	What does political affiliation have to do with racism?????Plenty of White Southern Democrats have called blacks "Boy"Matter of fact, they invented it.
535	I don't care that she said it. Did it hurt the dead baby's feelings?
536	Ok ok when I sing O Danny's boy no one is gonna break out into a chorus with me...Shit guys come onLet's do Irish Spring.....Come on....we can do this...
537	George Washington was a White Southern Democrat?
538	Son? When one 'MAN' exhibits Rascism on ANY level? They are a BOY to me.Learn it, live it, KNOW it.
539	For crying out loud see post 135.We go back and forth man. Have some fun out there.
540	Really, BOY?
541	Nice deflection IDIOT.
542	Color didnt matter either. I recall hitch hiking while on leave. What you doing on my freeway Boy. I told him and got a ride for about 50 miles. He was a good ole boy.
543	Weak son... *I* have YOU by the shorthairs, and you know it.Squirm yer way out rascist.
544	Dude, This is a message board.Hahahaha."Squirm"?Hahahaha.
545	Whoa geeze, you're not up to speed lately. And the head honchos have been really giving themselves mega bucks to the point you want to throw up. It's disgusting.
546	Who has the final say on the blackness of President Obama?
547	So? This is in your alternate universe Debate? Really?*I* retact the offer of debate.YOU aren't worth it.YOU are like debating a child.Same mindset.Retracted.
548	Funny how you retracted after I picked a topic.Run Boy, Run.Haha.
549	The populace.
550	G O D.Happy?
551	Cute Salt, very unworthy of you. As it was assumed I suppose to be about politics since that is the thread placement we are in.Enjoy your cheap moment because that will be all you will ever get.I bet you feel real proud too.
552	*I* am still HERE.
553	Statists love cheap thrills with no substance.
554	I am disappointed. I really thought Salt would be a formidable adversary.Man did I blow that call.
555	Nah...it's all good my friend...He outed himself for the rube he is.
556	Well Salt Peter? We're waiting...
557	Regards,SirJamesofTexas
558	Sherriff Joe and WND. Wow.Let us know how this turns out.
559	Details: Obama Socialist Party Membership
560	This post was written by SniperFire.
561	This post was written on 2012-03-12T14:52:00.
562	He joined in 1996, evidently.The "New Party" is a socialist/communist organization out of Chicago.America has been hoodwinked.
563	The NEW PARTY, now defunct, had LEFT wing opposition in the form of the Green Party. Where do you get "socialist" from.
564	Worst socialist ever.
565	This argument is along the lines of "Hitler can't be a socialist because he put communists in prison."It's just as stupid in both cases.
566	Try digging farther down than the headlines, toots.""""Obama gets involvedBarack Obama clearly saw the potential of the New Party, because he was soon seeking their support -alongside Michael Chandler, Willie Delgado, Miguel del Valle, Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez and Jesse Garcia.[3]"""""The newspaper article exaggerates. No one seeking a state senate seat is going to join a wild card third-rail political party. They are either going to be a Dem or a Republican. No exceptions. But you're so freaking naive I think you'd believe something scribbled on a napkin as long as it was critical of Obama.
567	Many conservatives accuse Hitler of being a leftist, on the grounds that his party was named "National Socialist." But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.
568	The President is not a Socialist. Calling for higher progressive taxes on the rich (ie a max out at 35% was it?) may be a cheap populous ploy to get reelected that won't solve any real problems, but it certainly doesn’t make Obama a socialist. Calling for a 30%ish tax rate on capital gains does not make you a socialist. Calling for Government run Healthcare that still has many aspects run by private insurers does not make you a socialist.Until Obama starts forcing every employer in the united states to start redistributing its profits equally amongst the employees who produce, or until he calls for maybe an 80-90% tax rate on the richest Americans so that it can be redistributed by the government, I’m not buying the socialist label. That’s total nonsense.
569	I don't think you are aware this was all public knowledge in the 2008 election year cycle, too.
570	caust/hitler110842.html
571	.This stuff just gets goofier and goofier. But I have to admit it's good comic relief..
572	Obama is a Marxist. No, he can't install Marxist doctrine quickly or easily because of that pesky old Constitution (the one he would dearly love to entirely ignore) and the fact that we have two sides of both Houses of Congress. He has been able to cram Obamacare down our throats in an attempt to gain government control of a large portion of our economy, he is slyly claiming to increase oil production (for purposes of getting votes) while he is actually inhibiting production (to drive fuel prices higher), he is slyly claiming to NOT want to control the public's handguns while backing such idiocy as Fast and Furious to gain support for gun control (too bad he got caught) and Hillary favors our signing a treaty with other countries to establish some sort of global gun control (that will infringe upon our constitutional rights), He has appointed umpteen unelected "Czars" to run various facets of government (go through the list of them-you will find socialists and Marxists and others with views diametrically opposed to American freedoms).Obama is a Marxist! He chooses his friends carefully...among them "my Marxist professors", Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayres...the list of anti-Americans goes on.Liberals kiss his ass because he is a slick talking black guy will extreme liberal ideals and that is ALL IT TAKES for them to rally. Pseudo-intellectual twits!Liberalism is a mental disorder.
573	You do understand that that racist pig Hitler was a Socialist exclusively for the supposed superior German race right. Death and slavery to all others whom he considered inferior. Calling his dream of a master race of ayrians a socialistic state does not really make him a Socialist. This was just a rah-rah speech to his faithful. He was a master propagandist and you must look at the actions of his regime rather than his speeches and or rhetoric.
574	Hitler was a Socialist, tool.Mussolini came DIRECTLY from the Socialist Party.Fascism is just another form of collectivist totalitarianism. Hell, Hitler stole Communist Russia's advertising campaign, right down to the posters and colors used to recruit.All Obama needs to do is grow one of those funny little mustaches.
575	The happiest place on earth is socialist....For the past decade, social scientists and pollsters have given elaborate questionnaires to hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. Two of the largest studies that rank the happiness of countries around the world are the World Map of Happiness from the University of Leiscester and the World Database of Happiness from Ruut Veenhoven of Erasmus University Rotterdam. All the happiness surveys ask people basically the same question: How happy are you?"The answer you get is not only how they feel right now, but also how they feel about their entire life," explained Dan Buettner, who has studied happiness and longevity around the world through his Blue Zones project Buettner said that if you mine all the databases of universities and research centers, you'll find that the happiest place on earth is ? Denmark. Cold, dreary, unspectacular Denmark.Could the Danes really be the happiest people in the world? When ABC News anchor Bill Weir traveled there to find out, he asked random Danes to rate themselves in terms of happiness, on a scale of one to 10. Many people rated themselves at least an eight, and there were several nines and 10s. Finally, one grouchy Dane came along who said she didn't believe Danes were so happy. But then she quickly conceded that she herself felt rather content with her life, and said Danes in general had very little to complain about.Danes do have one potential complaint: high taxes. The happiest people in the world pay some of the highest taxes in the world -- between 50 percent and 70 percent of their incomes. In exchange, the government covers all health care and education, and spends more on children and the elderly than any country in the world per capita. With just 5.5 million people, the system is efficient, and people feel "tryghed" -- the Danish word for "tucked in" -- like a snug child.Those high taxes have another effect. Since a banker can end up taking home as much money as an artist, people don't chose careers based on income or status. "They have this thing called 'Jante-lov,' which essentially says, 'You're no better then anybody else,'" said Buettner. "A garbage man can live in a middle-class neighborhood and hold his head high."
576	Hitler was a Roman Catholic..following Christian doctrine.
577	Gaze on the horrible face of socialism....
578	Rather dumbassed comment, even for you!"Christianity is an invention of sick brains," Adolf Hitler, 13 December 1941."So it's not opportune to hurl ourselves now into a struggle with the Churches. The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death," Adolf Hitler, 14 October 1941.
579	Socialism works great.Credit unions are socialist.The police department is socialist.The fire department is socialist.Public schools and universities are socialist.The U.S. military is socialist.Social Security is socialist and has worked well for 76 years.Medicare is socialist and is keeping my father alive.
580	For once I'm going to agree with you.This whole idea that Obama is a socialist is ridiculous. The man has done just as much to benefit big business as any republican.While everyone cries and whines about the regulatory legislation he's signed, the mega banks are thanking him for quelling even more competition.Obama is a corporatist, just like any other president has been.
581	Nope. And I've already proved you wrong on this before. I hope I don't need to do it again.
582	Hey, great idea, let's send our undocumented workers there. It's for their oen good. Let's just start out with a small number, say, 6, or 12, or 18 Million. After they get Citizenship, we can double our efforts. We are only looking out for their own good.Say what, Denmark's Infrastructure can't handle the overload? Why is that a factor? Why should that even matter?
583	Bad Boy. Do you really want the Pound to be our next stop? Shame on you.
584	Christianity has such a rich history!
585	No..actually you were proven wrong. Your attempt to scrub history however..is nothing new.
586	Love the czar reference as if "wink wink" no other president has appointed any, who btw do not have any real power.
587	You give Rabid a bad name sometimes. Am I to conclude that any claim anyone makes regarding Christianity is representative of it in an Authoritarian way? With that logic, or non logic, everyone loses, Sallow. Nothing is untouched. I knew you were an Anarchist at heart.
588	Still, you can't fool me.
589	Swallow chooses to ignore the Hitler quotes which obviously refute his lame arguement.
590	So Predictable.
591	Using the lily-white Danes as an example of socialism working. LOL
592	FASCISM -- a form of socialism that puts the burden of external costs onto the collective while retaining all profits for the elite propertied class known as BIG CAPITAL.
593	Rabid what? Are you denying the Church was involved in some remarkably bad events? Like the Spanish Inquisition? Or the Crusades? The Christian faiths don't even like each other, historically. And the bible is filled with all sorts of tales of genocide.It took someone like Pope John Paul, to recognize this bad behavior and apologize for it. He also tried to bring all faiths together. Pope Benedict, given his Nazi past, was a remarkably bad choice, however.Personally? I don't care..but if someone tries to muck up the history..heck..I will chime in.To me..all religions are batshit crazy.
594	Listen cum gargler...no swallow. There are places for you. They are called glory holes.And I asked you to source your quotes. You didn't. Doesn't matter..they are probably hearsay. As in..lifted from a "private" conversation.
595	I don’t agree with a lot of liberal views, but it’s definitely not a mental disorder.
596	Didn't you read the top of the paper?"A Fair Economy."That is code word for "public ownership of resources and production."
597	The lazy Totalitarian's Utopia.
598	You're a free thinking libertarian. You know damn well Obama serves corporate interests first. That's the antithesis of a marxist.Who do you think benefited the most from Dodd-Frank and Obamacare? Corporate America.Big banks thank Obama for the competition killing regulation in Dodd-Frank, and big insurance companies thank him for the healthcare mandate.Marxism is supposed to take from the top and give to the bottom. Obama's record so far has taken everything from the bottom and given it to the top.
599	Well given your off putting pronouncement there, bucko..I would say your "honest historian" approach to the topic is somewhat questionable in itself.But hey..if you guys don't want to talk about Hitler, Christianity..or religion in general.It might be a good idea not to bring it up?Eh?
600	Dodd-Frank kills competition, how exactly?Oh..and I've worked for the financial industry for some 15 years. So do be specific.I agree with you on ObamaCare. Huge gift to HMOs.
601	The fact that the government sets limits on credit products and mandates compensation rules puts smaller community banks at the most disadvantage because the mega banks can afford the extra financial burden this causes while the smaller banks are priced out of the market. The government can determine whether a bank is offering an unfair product and can ration credit. Who do you think gets hurt the most? You think the big banks are really hurting from the increased regulatory burden? Not if you look at the stock market they're not.The smaller banks that had nothing to do with the financial crisis now pay the penalty of increased compliance cost that really doesn't do anything to hurt the large banks at the end of the day.
602	Not necessarily.1.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant uses its massive power to lobby congress to pass a bill that would somehow limit the innovation capabilities of a small competing company, in order to ensure that the giant will retain it's super hold on the industry - is that a fair economy?2.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant lobbies congress to make sure that only it gets a tax break, or a subsidy, via some obscure loophole, in order to give the company an edge over smaller competitors - is that a fair economy?Saying that you "want a fair economy" is not interchangeable with saying that you want "public ownership of resources and production". It can simply mean that you want to correct some of the unfair advantages the industry superpowers have because of their enhanced access to Congress.Often, it's the Capitalists who are the biggest threat to the Free Market.
603	1) No.... That's a Hamilton Economy.2) Same thing.You know, the type of card game where the Government deals the cards, peaks at what it is holding, and then makes up the rules for that hand, and tells us only what it says we need to know. You should know that by now.
604	The New Party is not The Socialist Party.
605	Show me where I am not being honest. Hey it's Buckaroo, not Bucko. No point getting nastier, Flea Magnet. Hitler was a Socialist Despot. Just another label for Totalitarian Control heading the same way as the others. Nothing new there. I talk about Christianity all the time. What's your point or question? I talk about Religion.
606	Obama serves State Capitalism First. Big difference. The Big Companies are already in the Noose.
607	Dumbass,The Nazis created socilized medical care, they put production under the control of the Govt with select individuals (Nazi Party members) being the owners and raking in the money on the backs of Jew workers. They talked about a collective society, everyone pitching in.They hated the communists because they were farther left and were.....SLAVS, Russians.....an inferior race to the German blonde machine.Now, shut the fuck up.
608	Oh brother. Berzerk, you are one stupid ass. Check on the name Bismark for the source of socialized medicine in Germany.
609	The Nazis viewed the communists as competition for power in the country, so they suppressed them. It is like Democrats squashing the Green party, only 1 party can rule from the left.....idiot.
610	Hitler was not a Socialist, he was a Fascist.Which Mussolini will tell you, is Corporatism, "as it is the merger of corporate and government power."But hey, don't let Mussolini tell you about Fascism, I'm sure Sean Hannity knows much more about it.
611	The Nazis merged corporations into giant Cartels, under the control of their buddies.As Mussolini said, it was the merging of corporate and government power.The Government didn't take over the corporations, the corporations merged with government.And they didn't redistribute equally or "each according to their needs".And certainly, 100%, subjugating a portion of the population, and making them an underclass (before exterminating them) is in no way in keeping with Marxist theory.But again, don't take my word for it, or Mussolini's, I'm sure Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity are much more knowledgeable. After all, they had those years of drug addiction in which to become experts.
612	Yeah??? Who had control of the Courts, Cops, and Prisons??? Who controlled the Currency, the Banks??? Who took the Bullet when Hitler received a report he did not like???It is all about Centralized Government Control. You point at Figure Heads, Marionettes, and proclaim, this is different, this is not like that, our brand is unlike any other, yet still the same mass murder results, the same Tyranny, the same end, Totalitarianism.
613	Nobody distributes according to need in the end. That is the point. Human Nature is Selfish. Totalitarian Control places the needs of those in Power, over Everyone else. There is no Justice Served, only Reward for Loyalty. 2+2=5 for as long as you say so. 2+2=5? Yes or No. What is it Worth to You? 2+2=5 For as long as you say it does. End Scene.
614	Yes, it is Totalitarianism.That is utterly correct, and Totalitarianism is wrong as wrong can be.But it is not necessarily Socialism.And most certainly it's not in any way related to any of the Democratic Socialist governments in existence today.
615	Obama may be a socialist, or may be he's not. I don't give a hoot. What everyone does know is that he is incompetent. That is why a majority of voting Americans will vote to kick his skinny ass to the curb, and send him on a permanent vacation.
616	For now. They are not yet that far corrupted. At the Time, his time, Socialism was his tool. Fortunately for us, Hitler was his own worst Enemy, and undermined his own efforts in WWII. He came very close. Fortunately for us his concept of true Socialism only applied to Pure Blooded Aryans. so in effect, his bigotry, was part of his weakness.Nazism, the common short form name of National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus) was the ideology and practice of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (otherwise known as the Nazi Party) and of Nazi Germany.[1][2][3][4] It is a unique variety of fascism that incorporates biological racism and antisemitism.[5] Nazism was founded out of elements of the far-right racist völkisch German nationalist movement and the violent anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary culture that fought against the uprisings of communist revolutionaries in post-World War I Germany.[6] The ideology was developed first by Anton Drexler and then Adolf Hitler as a means to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. [7] Initially Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, though such aspects were later downplayed in the 1930s to gain the support from industrial owners for the Nazis; focus was shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes.[8] Nazism promoted political violence, militarism, and war, it conceived of politics as being a "battle", and the Nazis utilized their paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA) for violent attacks upon those they opposed, particularly communists, Jews, and social democrats. [9] Hitler and the Nazis openly promoted German territorial expansionism into Eastern Europe to be Lebensraum ("living space") for German settlers that would result in the creation of a "Greater Germanic Realm".[10]Nazism advocated the supremacy of the claimed Aryan master race over all other races.[11] Nazis viewed the progress of humanity as depending on the Aryans and believed that it could maintain its dominance only if it retained its purity and instinct for self-preservation.[12] They claimed that Jews were the greatest threat to the Aryan race.[13] They considered Jews a parasitic race that attached itself to various ideologies and movements to secure its self-preservation, such as capitalism, the Enlightenment, industrialisation, liberalism, Marxism, democracy, and trade unionism.[13] To maintain the purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to exterminate Jews, Romani, and the physically and mentally disabled.[14] Other groups deemed "degenerate" and "asocial" who were not targeted for extermination, but received exclusionary treatment by the Nazi state, included: homosexuals, blacks, Jehovah's Witnesses and political opponents.[14]Nazism promoted an economic system that supported a stratified economy with classes based on merit and talent while rejecting universal egalitarianism, retaining private property, freedom of contract, and promoted the creation of national solidarity that would transcend class distinction.[15][16] Hitler claimed that unconditional equality of opportunity for all able racially-sound Aryan German males in Germany was the essence of the socialism of German National Socialism. [17] This was known as völkisch equality that officially ascribed collective racial equality of opportunity, equality before the law, and full legal rights to able people of Aryan blood but deliberately excluded people outside of this definition who were regarded as inferior and rejected the conception of universal human equality.[18] The Nazis criminalized strikes by employees and lockouts by employers for being contrary to national unity and the state took over the approval process of setting wage and salary levels.[19]The Nazis were presented by Hitler and other proponents and viewed by some scholars as being neither left-wing nor right-wing but politically syncretic.[20][21][22][23] However major elements of Nazism have been deemed as clearly far-right, such as its goals of the right of claimed superior people to dominate while purging society of claimed inferior elements.[24]
617	Excellent piece, which proves the point that Nazi Fascism was not Socialism, even though they used the label in the beginning to create a false image to draw popularity for their cause.Just because Hitler liked to use the term "German Socialism" to describe something that was clearly not in fact socialism, doesn't make Hitler's statements accurate.Hitler was an opportunist. He would have adapted any philosophy to gain power.
618	It has attributes of both. Both of which are Totalitarian by the way.
619	The stock market has doubled since the stimulus.3.9 million private sector jobs have been created since 2009.GDP has been growing since 2009.Americans net worth is up $9 trillion dollars since 2009.Auto sales are up. Retail sales are up. Home sales are up. Unemployment is down.GM was saved, and is now the number one automaker in the world.Obama has done a very good job.
620	are you trying to convince us that Nazi Germany was not controlled by by an all powerful central government ????
621	That's called fascism, not socialism.Denmark has socialism.
622	What is Interest doing lately? On Bonds, Savings? If You have money, where are you going to put it when Interest is below the Rate of Inflation?How about we just Audit the Federal Reserve? Is that too much to ask or expect?Ho much is a Trillion worth today as compared to 2000? 2008? 20011?
623	What percentage of the World's population lives in Denmark?
624	Where are you going to put your money?Income property or stocks.Stocks are at 14 PE which is historically low.And income property will pay off because we have reached the bottom of the real estate market.
625	Move there, now
626	Disgusting, aren't they.
627	We really should stop calling Obama a Socialist.It's giving Socialism a bad name.
628	What does the population of Denmark matter?
629	This is more lame than the Breitbart video.
630	Unheard Of: Obama Unleashes Attack Ad Aimed At Sarah Palin, A Civilian. Why?
631	This post was written by Mudslinger.
632	This post was written on 2012-03-11T18:47:00.
633	Of all people he releases a campaign attack ad on her and not the other candidates. She is a civilian and not running for office as of now. In watching the ad it is apparent that Governor Palin is actually correct in her statements. All I can say is that Obama must be scared that she will force a brokered convention and it looks like it might happen the way the GOP pundits are talking. This attack ad clearly defines a sense of insecurity coming from the Obama campaign pertaining to her.
634	he probably wants people to associate republicans with Sarah Palin.
635	She is not running for office at this very moment, but she has already hinted at a brokered convention and stepping up as an alternate choice....and she is also out there for future offices.Unless you want to tell us that Palin announced that she is no longer a politician, with no plans to ever run for office again.......has she?
636	I guess Obama is trying to get Wall Street to fund a second election for him.
637	Sounds to me like some of that $1 million that Bill Maher gave to the Obama campaign was earmarked to attack that XXXXXXXX from Alaska.I honestly believe that Billy Boy Maher is SCARED TO DEATH of Sarah Palin, because she KILLS things and EATS them.The immaturity level of the leftists is frightening.That word is not to be used outside the flame zone.
638	He's just trying to make some money somehow. I guess his billion dollar warchest is a little anorexic...
639	Because she is the epitome of conservative/tea party thinking.
640	so you're saying Bill Maher didn't know what he was talking about.removed quoted obcenity
641	Either that or -- on a highly selective basis -- it's ok with bodey and certain other libs to refer to a woman as a XXXXXXCome on people, this word is not supposed to be here outside of the flame zone. YOu all know this. You are making me work for my paycheck?
642	Bill Maher is a comedian. You DID know that, right?NOt outside the flame zone guys.
643	I don't like Andrew Dice Clay either....but I don't moan and groan about what he calls women.This is like seven posts and I am thinking this thread needs to be trashed...... Not outside the flame zone guys
644	Bullshit.Comedians are supposed to be funny.
645	But you do object when Rush suggested (albeit invalidly and kind of stupidly) that a woman a "slut" who made herself a public figure was asking to get reimbursed for contraceptives so that she could afford sex.Hm.Interesting basis for important critical distinctions you appear not to have...
646	Virgins can't use birth control pills?
647	You are trying to tell lies often enough to make people believe them. Very dishonest of you.
648	Obama knows that Palin's not running for office, right? I can't assume he does know that based on 57 states.
649	Speaking of irrelevancies, how the fuck are you bro?
650	Because he's a punk.
651	but he was serious in that moment.
652	Except, lonelylaughable, I didn't lie at all. You just did.Not surprising.
653	Come on, we all know that Obama cares about what his daughters would think.. and would never attack a WOMAN for his political gain..
654	He wants everyone to assume the republican party IS Palin. cause He'd destroy Palin in an election.
655	Based on what?
656	Why would you expect Obama to run on his record?now he's resorting to attacking women instead.
657	I guess so......
658	Half the GOP IS Palin, and Fox lying heads are NOT civilians. DUMB.
659	If I have to explain it to you......
660	OK, I'll bite....how did Obama attack Palin?
661	And accordingly, you're ok with what he said about her on the basis that he dislikes her political views (as do you)....
662	Let me ask you. Do you think Limbaugh really meant what he said about Fluke?
663	Ah, he's running against a strawman.Good.(While he's worrying about straw, Romney can gain votes.)
664	I hope that's the case.
665	Maher was about as serious as Limbaugh was. Neither one of them should have said what they said.
666	To me it looks like private citizen Palin is attacking Obama
667	Me too. He'll keep the votes from the O-bots who would support him no matter what he does. He'll not win the votes from those who are against him no matter what he does. So far, zero gain, zero loss among those groups.But, I can't see this being effective for the undecided and independents. They pay more attention than those who practice contempt/adoration without prior investigation.So, base on that...........You go, Mr. President!
668	How can you tell with your head planted so far up Obamas ass?
669	Can you link us to similar ads against Romney, Santorum or Gingrich?
670	So Obama is just showing how Presidential he really is..
671	fuck palin that whore deserves however she's treated for daring to be a conservative...oh wait.............
672	Last election he ran against George Bush.I guess it's easier to campaign against people that aren't in the race.
673	oh please.....
674	what happened to 'truth to power'....
675	Obama thinks he IS speaking truth to power. He must be afraid of Palin.
676	so why is Imus fair game and Maher isn't?
677	Maher was removed from abc, if you recall. Maher doesn't get any shit cause he's now on cable, while LImpballs has to worry about sponsors. His apology made him look like such a whore.
678	I think his apology was appropriate.The point he was trying to make may have been meritorious. But he used Fluke as an object of ridicule and the underlying basis for his claim WAS simply off. So his point got buried.
679	I didn't see Obama say anything
680	I don't like it when people publicly apologize in these situations. It's always manufactured.
681	Make the comment in a big venue. Make the apology in the big venue. If that makes his apology look phony, too bad. He can deal with the fallout. It's all on him at that point and he deserves no particular sympathy over it.But he did still owe her the courtesy of admitting that he had gone too far. And on that basis I still maintain he deserves some props for at least making the apology.
682	I think I am missing something here. Where is this attack ad to be seen? The link actually goes to an anti Obama ad. I can't find any other reference to this supposed anti Palin ad or where or when it was made or aired. It kinda looks like recycled stuff from a few years ago. Does anyone have any kind of link to where this ad was "unleashed"?
683	Do you really think he thinks he went too far? I hate McNabb. but McNabb was right that Limbaugh shouldn't apologize to him, cause it wouldn't have been genuine.
684	Palin is a political pundit.And therefore a valid target.If she just stayed out of the political forefront she would qualify as a civilian.
685	If Palin hadn't made that statement last week, the OP might have a point.As it stands, the Breitbart hate machine (which also hosts this link) has tried to muckrake off of race baiting.It was stupid, and Obsma is going to make money off of it (and win votes).Limbaugh is going to get some ad time too. If you think Obama is just going to run against the GOP candidate, you have a surprise coming. He's going to run against the hateful far right.If the GOP was smart, they'd distance themselves from the far right. They won't though. They'll double down on crazy.
686	Hopefully the Democratic Party will distance themselves from the hateful leftists.
687	What dont you guys understand about the public airwaves and the FCC?
688	Supposed to be, not all are. Or do you disagree with that? (All I have to do is think of Larry the Cable Guy)
689	now come on, that's different..they stand in "solidarity" with theirs
690	Yeah that guy is about as funny as a stopped up toilet.
691	half his jokes are about toilets, aren't they?
692	Or in the toilet.
693	You wouldn't recognize thinking if you saw it.
694	You get a paychecK?
695	Does anyone know if this is for real? I can't find where there is any anti Palin ad from the Obama campaign. I see an anti Obama ad in the link provided but I don't see any anti Palin ad. I have Googled this thing and tried to find some outside evidence that there has actually been an attack ad released on Palin, but I can't find anything. I mean... if it's for real, I'd like to see it see and and maybe ask why the Obama campaign is going after Palin.... but I can't even tell if this is for real or just made up stuff. It doesn't seem to really exist. Is this the norm around here? Speak first, verify later?
696	Then you'd better report her to ATTACK WATCH!!
697	, she vomited that crap on HanNITWITty's hate fest TV show less than 4 DAYS ago, and Obama has every right to call the lying POS on it.
698	Well here is the wrong place to look for it that is certain.
699	I recognize a fat ass air force member retiring, looking like he's one pork chop away from a heart attack.P.S. I mean you, fatso.
700	you would know about hate...it just oozes from you postings..so he has to right to attack any of us citizens for criticizing him, is that what I'm hearing.?what a pathetic unPresidential low class person..and I hope he comes after you people NEXT
701	It looks like a stupid fuck racist said something, but it can't be important. Stupid fuck racists never say anything important.Did I mention you're an unimportant stupid fuck racist? True story!
702	And it will just get worse the closer the election gets.The collective intelligence of the nation is dropping day by day.
703	This President is the most childish, petulant, and spoiled brat who's ever thrown a tantrum in the Oval Office.He makes Jimmy Carter look butch by comparison.
704	First, only a complete moron believes there will be a brokered convention and that Sarah Palin will come out as the GOP candidate despite not having spent a single day on the campaign trail.So that is not the motive behind this ad.The motive behind this ad is that most Americans find Sarah Palin to be a complete dumbass. And so any association Obama can make between Palin and the GOP will pull the Undecideds off the fence toward his side.
705	Only thing is, Carter was really a weenie. Obama is snickering about playing the Useful Idiots into believing he is picked on.
706	well take a look at the people who still support him..they aren't any better.hope he is gone in November, can't stand the guy myself
707	Yet you quoted my post, fatso.You stretched that uniform so tight the cammo pattern turned to horizontal stripes.
708	Hope?Last month you were sure.
709	Obama attacked no one on that video. Celebutard Palin was the only person speaking so she must have been attacking herself with her own hateful stupidity. All the video does is ask for donations.It's already raised over $5 million, so Obama says thanks Celebutard Palin and Lying Sean HanNITWITty!
710	It could hardly be called an attack ad on Celebutard Palin since it is only her hateful words followed by a request for donations. But here is the link:
711	No problem..it just shows their desperation and makes people feel sorry for Palin..so have it..you people are cutting your own throats..
712	Carter is already gone.
713	attack herself???
714	hey I said no problem, use Palin for whatever the hell, you will just make people feel sorry for her and make the Obama his crew look, SEXIST..now you can stop spraying our computers with spittle, please
715	There was nothing said by Palin that was hateful. She exposed the truth about Obama wanting class warfare and division in the country. She was right on target as usual. Obama needs to be truly vetted this time around.
716	Am I the only one that wants a neutral or at least not extremist source to confirm that this ad even exist? Where was the ad supposedly "unleashed"? The only thing I can find is this single website making the claim and that web site can not be trusted without supporting evidence that the whole claim isn't just a hoax.
717	Four years ago Obama basically ignored McCain/Palin and ran against Bush.Is this ad a harbinger of how Obama will run this year? Finally confronting Palin?
718	I already posted it for you!
719	I wouldn't touch that link with a ten foot computer..might get cooties..
720	Ok. Now I see it. It's a campaign youtube. I thought it was supposed to be some sort of network ad or something by the "UNLEASHED" title. Man, everyone has to sensationalize these days. Anyway... Ok, yeah, the Obama campaign used Palins remarks in an ad for campaign contributions. I don't see a whole lot of reason except politics as usual. I wouldn't go after Palin if I were running the campaign. She's a pretty polarizing figure on her own, you don't really have to go after her, I don't think. She'll turn off some and turn on others, she's a non factor far as I am concerned.Now...who knows anything about recruiting for the new EPA clean air rules? THAT is a campaign story with some meat in it!
721	They're childish, petulant, and spoiled brats as well.
722	Did anyone worth listening to say something?Nope.
723	Let's see.....racism, sexism, are there any other isms involved in this?Oh, right. Opportunism.
724	Yes, I too am watching their progression of terminology on this election.
725	Declaring War on fellow Citizens is what 'Community Organizing' is all about. Look at who the President is. He has declared War on his fellow Citizens since day one. Look at his recent attacks on the Church for example. That's exactly what 'Community Organizing' is all about. Saul Alinsky would truly be proud of his disciple.
726	The lying POS said Obama wanted to take us back to the pre Civil War days of slavery!
727	Palin talking about Palin is not the same as Obama talking about Palin.Your link was a waste of time.BUT please PLease PLEASE nominate Palin for Preident.The laughs never end with you Rethugs. Lost is what you all are.
728	She's correct. Obama is a deep racial radical divider.
729	Interesting that Obama's reaction was to try and profit financially from it.
730	Sarah and Rush are leaders/spokesmen for the GOP. You can't call them civilians. Doesn't she work for Fox News?
731	Because he wanted to run against Palin and now it looks like he might get a second bite at the apple, that's why. If your opponent is determined to hang themselves, by all means give them more rope.
732	Palin, Romney and Pilate were governors.
733	I think she is also still a paid performer at TP events?
734	In between the ventriloquist act and the seals.
735	Obama's got two choices:a. talk about BushRushPalin orb. talk about his record (record debt, deficits, poverty, foreclosures, unemployment, food stamps, poverty and our first ever credit down grade)
736	In all fairness, he only said that because someone had left a bottle of ketchup in front of his teleprompter.
737	Community Disorganizer - A person who specializes in causing divisions and turmoil in a target community.
738	repeating that enough still doesn't make it true, you all have been trying it for years now.
739	Jesus didn't act like Alinsky or Obama,IDIOT.
740	Wrong. Jesus didn't stay in a community did he? Move around. A lot.
741	He sure did. he had a habit of disappearing for awhile too to get in touch with himself and God.Interesting Statists use/compare Jesus to score political points when they think it's convienient.
742	If your MessiahRushie can question whether Fluke is a private citizen simply because she testified publicly, then Celebutard Palin is no private citizen either.March 06, 2012RUSH: Well, I don't know if she's a "private citizen" testifying before a congressional subcommittee
743	She went PUBLIC with the help of the Statist Democrats and ceased as a private citizen in her testimony...and she wen further on the 'Talkshow' Circuit.Guess what? YOU LOSE the argument.Her purpose was malignant, deceitful, purposeful by targeting a Religious school nefariously in her intent.Cya crotch-sniffer.
744	Palin is a political professional. She has a PAC that raises money to use against Obama and other Democrats.She is fair game.
745	and that means even calling her a Cxxt I take it.
746	Hey NYcuminhisrear,Did you defend Allen West when he went after Wasserman Schultz? Didn't think so, hack.
747	President Obama called Palin a hoohah???? lol I'm going to have to see a link to that one.
748	Did you?
749	To me it looks like private citizen Palin is attacking Obama__________________He should NOT respond. where is the attack ad by the way?
750	So someone who enters the political arena is fair game? That is exactly what Ms. Fluke did. Having been on TV, she now has made money from her views.
751	You got it, he and other dimwits are scared of her. That has been painfully obvious since mccain picked her.
752	Just as Cindy Sheehan...she will be used and abused...and then thrown on the dungheap of Statist forlorn tools.
753	But that's different.Is just is.
754	Good, she can use the money. That is different then the thug obamaturd sending his thugs to Alaska to dig up dirt on her. Obamaturd is scared of Sarah, and I laugh at his fear.
755	For calling her obscene names? How's that working out for Limbaugh?
756	So you're acknowledging that the premise of this retarded thread is horseshit.Okay.
757	From Breitbart; Obama uses Palin's insult to highlight GOP hard right; SURPRISE?
758	A better question is, why should it work out for Mr. Obama?
759	Nope, just point out your hypocracy.
760	do you do anything other than deflect?
761	why********************************He cannot respond the the 4 candidates still slugging it out in the primaries; and may believe, as do I, Palin sunk the ticket in 2008.
762	Slut isn't obscene. Cunt or dumb-twat is obscene.
763	McCain sunk it by muzzling her...because SHE was more energetic than he...and he got pissed about it.McCain sunk his own ship and aspirations.
764	No......the crusty shriveled up McCain sunk the ticket.
765	Precisely.
766	So someone who enters the political arena is fair game? That is exactly what Ms. Fluke did.************************************************** **Fluke ran for election?
767	Fluke made herself a public figure by testifying before congress. She furthered that by giving interviews before Rush said a word. Get over it. She's fair game if anybody is.
768	Because he knows he can't win if he runs on his record?
769	Flucke is part of Obama's "Wag the Pill" campaign, or better known as "The GOP War On Women".First they dropped the hammer on the Catholic Church.Then they bring this woman up to tell her sob storyThen they release this HBO movie "Game Change" to attack Sarah Palin.......because Rush attacked Flucke....it's only fairThen they release an ad calling Sarah Palin a racist and beg for money to stop her.It's pretty despicable if you ask me. Obama thinks he has a license to steal.I can't say they planned it all this way, but the White House is behind all of this.
770	We disagree then; I admired McCain, Palin appeared out of her league. CIVILIAN is an odd term to use; she has been in the media spotlight as much as she can; she ENDORSED Newt, remember?
771	Sorry. let me know if I should draw little pictures next time.
772	Mea culpa.I forgotted.
773	And endorsing Newt was wrong of her to express whom she favoured?Tell us again how a citizen endorsing someone is wrong?
774	From my perspective she was exciting while he was just plain boring.She's a fighter and he's just a nice old guy with a slight mean streak.Nobody was excited about McCain. He was the last choice most people wanted.
775	ONe does not become a politician by testifying before Congress.....sorry to break it to you.
776	One can be a public figure without being a politician.True fact.
777	You have not broken anything to anyone in a long time. You being sorry is another thing entirely........It's typical for a liberal to be sorry about everything.Sorry is as sorry does.
778	Obama will only hurt himself with this ad. There's millions of people that really "like" Sarah Palin--even though they believe she should not be President--she is indeed a civilian--not running for office--and I see this unfounded attack back-firing on him. Who knows--"maybe it's Obama's WAR ON WOMEN"--that he is trying to engage--LOL
779	No....you become a target for the Obama Administration simply by asking a question.
780	Note the link I gave? Obama is worried...
781	Palin gets in front of every camera she can find; no comparison with a "civilian".
782	She does? Seems to me it is the media seeking HER out...
783	She is eager to oblige; Obama responded to one of her insults. No candidate to oppose, yet, and possibly not until AFTER Tampa.
784	One does not need to be a politician to be a public figure.
785	Good point, it isin't like Fluke ever gets in front of a camera, or has a PR firm.
786	Whether she's EAGER is NOT the question...the POINT is that the media is there looking for it is more the point.Sorry hon...FAIL.
787	Palin has stayed a public figure AFTER being a politican. We are comparing two public figures at present.
788	the POINT is that the media is there looking for it is more the point.**********************************************And if she ignored, the "leftist" media is sexist! Round  round. Palin is happy, raking in big money.
789	We still have the interesting comparision of Limbaugh to Obama in attacking lesser public figures.
790	One is an entainer or head of the Republican party depending on whom you ask on any day in the leftist media that can't make up thier minds...*VERSUS* the actual Standards bearer of the Democrats...Hmmmm....
791	Oh noes! How shall they ever deflect this one?
792	Looked at the 'PALIN THREADS' around these parts lately? And the root stories?Strange that is, isn't it?
793	REQUEST AN EVENT is part of the menu : )
794	i think you need to pull your head in,,,
795	Nope. I didn't defend him or maher or limbaugh. Shit sucker.
796	Public figures speak in public on occasion. Shocking huh? PACs are political action C-o-m-m-i-t-e-e-s.
797	And so what?I'm sure the MEDIA monitors it like the paperazzi that they are...Cult of personality shitheads...
798	Her site offers many, many ways to put money in her "cause"; plus lots of scheduled EVENTS.
799	So? Do you actually have a point?
800	Palin is a political professional. She has a PAC that raises money to use against Obama and other Democrats.**********************************NY! SarahPAC offers much more:
801	T; SarahPAC invites the media!
802	The way you guys salivate and defend Limpbum you would think he was the GoP standard bearer. In fact, other than delivery of his message he's a mixture of Santorum and Romney..
803	Game, Set, match.Pay attention, shall you?
804	Palin asks for both money and media inquiries; a civilian with a PAC? C'mon, Sarah P. has cleaned up since dragging McCain down. Wonder why she walked on her job:
805	You just glossed over my post, didn't you?Typical.
806	Where is your outrage over Obama attacking a citizen? To, oh my, raise funds for his PAC. Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my!
807	Never fear, the CIVILIAN SarahPAC takes a full range of credit cards:
808	Where is your outrage of a sitting President attacking private citizens?YOU must have adored Nixon, huh?
809	I have no outrage. She is a target -deservedly so....
810	The media follows HER? She promotes herself:
811	Like Palin?
812	Sweet....We just need your number then...
813	Yes, so I'll ask again, why the lack of outrage over President Obama's behavior?
814	But the left spends so much time telling us that she's a NON FACTOR and should be discredited...but yet they are on her heel like the Hounds of the Baskervilles...slobbering all over themselves jockeying over the next tidbit.Spare us.
815	Amazing. Cheap. Nasty. Low class. Vicious.This shows the hypocrisy and double standards by which liberals live.
816	Obama called Palin a slut?That was my outrage.
817	All true, which has what to do with her being hassled by Obama. never give a sucker an even break...Palin is a sucker...
818	Well played...
819	Palintologists are even bigger suckers enriching Palins coffers
820	Those that are enamoured WITH the O are the larger suckers.Bought into a bill of goods that are largely LIES of a Marxist Hell-Bent on destroying this Country.
821	Anyone enamoured with any politician is a sucker.
822	Such a private person:
823	Going with the, "she deserved it" defense? Rush should have consulted you prior to his apology. When is Obama going to apologize? I mean for the Palin thing, not our military.
824	I think Obama is ok at best. Not even close to being a marxist, and every time you spout that, you get people thinking you're a nutbar...
825	Photoshopped.I have seen the real pic.No I am not sorry about that.
826	YOU don't know his history nor care what he has done shows him to be one...but then YOU don't Live here so what the FUCK do YOU care anyway?
827	With rightwingers you either love a republican or love Obama.That absolutest thought process...
828	Just looked at the ad. Why does he need to apologise for it? Seems rather tame IMO...
829	WHY do you keep following her?************************Difficult to AVOID in the news; the suggestion she is a "civilian" was shot down, accept reality. SHE chose to remain a political figure, I doubt her PAC was forced upon her by the MEDIA.
830	(A) that's not true.(B) that's not true.(C) that's not true and(D) with you left wingers, it's you either love President Obama or you're a racist. Your absolutist thought process sucks big time.
831	I know just as much about him as you do. It's not hard to find out about his history.The president of the US and your congress affect the way of the world. So, you don't live in Iran or Iraq or Afghanistan. What are the odds of me finding posts of yours commenting on those countries on this board?
832	Because it insults a TP goddess.
833	Pretty much my take on the Fluke outrage. I use the Palin point as a comparision of equal weight. Neither should be a problem.
834	thanks for proving my point.
835	Yeah, that's right. Fluke ran for office of the vice president of the United States and will probably have another crack in the near future, while Obama called Palin a slut on nationally syndicated radio. I see that comparison working....
836	I know him by deeds...as to his history I know him by his writings...'Dreams Of My Father'...And other rantings he has made.HE is a Manchild... malignant Narcissist...not suited to be POTUS...or Dogcatcher...I restate...YOU don't live here...WHY should you care?
837	More like Fluke was trying to run for Pope.
838	Konrad is a retard.
839	Umm the pope is against the pill.She is however the leader of the Church of Palintology.Try again there hotshot.
840	Good thing he didn't say "politician", huh?
841	Hugely.True Story.
842	I like slutty girls BTW. As being out to stud is my job! And the Dirty Sluts are the only ones that will get a chance at any ring from me! Sorry girls just like action as you do too! Almost 7.5 inches but thick.And would love to be raped by any 7.2 and above. As many time as you need, if able to comply. Will fly in to the service your needs free. Dinner and drinks included as well a massage too. Enjoy!
843	As she covertly forces the POPE to try on a condom against his will.
844	Like this wasn't Winnifred in the Winnibago?
845	Would somebody please ban this fuckwit?
846	A civilian?? She gets paid millions to lie like a rug about the president. And she's been running that racist classist stupidity since she said he was "pallin' around with terrorists".I know rightwingnuts would loooooove for her to go unanswered because you're not supposed to tell when a rightwingnut is lying.(the answer is... when they're moving their lips).It's not about "insecurity", it's that apparently, there are people who actually believe her nonsense.She could always stop lying. *shrug*
847	Pelosi tried. Come on. She told the Pope he was wrong about abortion.Dying laughing here. Only bitch one could think on the planet who could tell Henry the 8th that he fucked up on all his others and really didn't need to cut the Catholic Church off at the knees just to marry Anne.Yuppers. That's Nancy.GGoooooGooooooo Pelosii!!!!
848	You probably dont need a second, but here I am as back up.
849	What is a civilian? To me, it's someone who's non-military.
850	Damn it all!I agree with Fullauto.
851	She's a hack.Cripes we have her pegged to the wall.
852	Who's that supposed to be?
853	rape jokes are funny, right?You fucking idiot.
854	PDS was started by the left describing Palintologists.
855	So Sarah was doing the nasty before she got married to Todd? So she is a Holy slut?God's book old and new say this is a no, no! So I should and will follow her actions in this matter. A good god dame slut in my book.
856	Hey I can be raped if I want it. I have RIGHT'S!
857	Broke my no neg rule.That was an accomplishment.
858	It would be like having sex with a sheep or some other dumb animal.Yecho.
859	If she is true to her words. Todd was not sporting a rubber!
860	Come on, I feel some girls raped my ass a few times for weeks at first and I was under the impression I was the hunter. Being hunted is fun but I do have some standards please. And was trying to get out the door sometimes and shit, girls can be mean with their sexy outfits and words. This is unfair and should have some government oversight too!
861	A monkeys master for CavemanDave, I say
862	projecting again, drug addled nutbar??
863	That would be correct. But that's not how the poster intended it. She's trying to pretend that sarah isn't in politics.Luckily, most people aren't quite that disingenuous.
864	Granted, but I am still pretty sure that Sarah Palin and the Koch brothers are not running for anything. Why would Obama feel a need to campaign against them?
865	Because whether or not they're running for anything, they're still campaigning against him.
866	If they can't stand the heat...They've both damaged the Republican brand so much, they have to put up sort of defense. They've pretty much assured Reid keeps his job and Pelosi may be back! Any wonder they're scrambling?
867	Reid and Pelosi both need to go, along with drama queen Boehner, McConnel and at least 1/3 of congress.
868	Remember when Obama told Fluke he didn't like to see private citizens attacked?I do, yet he still chooses to run ads that attack private citizens.Notice how I am not the one defending the lying sack of shit here?
869	I'm not "defending" Obama. I don't give two shits about Obama. Nor did I claim that Fluke was a "private citizen" and shouldn't be attacked.When people make their politics known to the public at large, they're no longer "private citizens".And when some "private citizens" pay billions of dollars for ads attacking the President, I see no reason that the President shouldn't be allowed to respond to them.
870	You are not defending Palin?
871	Respond how? Sending the police to knock on their doors? In my opinion, presidents are not supposed to attack anyone who is not an enemy of this country, even if they make it a point to attack his policies, like Palin and the Kochs are perfectly free to do under the US constitution.Tell me something, do you remember Bush ever running adds or raising money based on the actions of people who did not like his policies? How about Clinton? Any president in your lifetime?
872	Objecting to the the most powerful man in the world running ads attacking people he is supposed to protect is not the same as defending the person who is being attacked.Just something to think about, you might find the thought that presidents, who can send the FBI, IRS, or any of dozens of other agencies, after people, should not attack anyone just because they disagree with him. Chavez started out by attacking people who said things about him, then he started taking their businesses, and then he started locking them up. I do not want to see this country go down the same road.
873	My argument does not rely on precedence. We didn't live in the world of SuperPACs under Bush or Clinton.
874	Tell me again you aren't defending Obama.
875	Unheard Of: Obama Unleashes Attack Ad Aimed At Sarah Palin, A Civilian. Why?Because he could? Was she injured?
876	I'm not "defending" Obama any more than I would be "defending" Bush if the situation was flipped - and I had the same view of the situation when Bush was President.
877	When did Bush ever attack anyone? You can't have the same view of something that didn't happen, unless you actually spend more time than you want to admit thinking about what ifs.
878	Who the fuck cares about Palin?
879	Touche.But my point stands. This isn't a Republican/Democrat thing. This is a basic rights thing.
880	I'd say it applies to several people in this thread.
881	You sure do lie a lot.
882	Too bad you're completely incapable of originality. But that's about all that can be expected from extremely stupid kids.
883	And that, of course, is the real crime here, isn't it? Not worshiping the little tin god?
884	Oh.....now Sarah Palin spent billions of dollars for attack ads?You're fucken high.
885	So it's okay to call anyone who campaigns against Obama racists???Obama says he doesn't want anyone trashing his kids. He says we need to tone all of this angry speech down.........then the prick turns around and pays for an ad calling Sarah Palin a racist. What does Palin have to do with anything? Why release that HBO movie now?This is all about silencing critics. Obama is no different than Rush Limbaugh. He's decided to trash Sarah Palin, a woman, and made a point of trashing her even after he called his political prop, Sandra Flucke, and apologized for Rush trashing her. The whole process has been a setup for these attacks against Palin.What a piece of shit.
886	She's doing the same thing as Obama.Attacking him to fundraise for her PAC.
887	There's no "crime" here.
888	But billions?????Wigger pleaze!!!!!
889	So you have no problem with Obama talking out of both sides of his mouth???Saying he's against the very thing he's doing himself???
890	What did he say he was against, that he's doing himself?
891	Sure."Millions", then.
892	He said that we all need to tone the angry rhetoric down.....then he does it himself.It's amazing you don't see this. Calling someone a racist is not exactly cordial. I guess he'd have to call her a slut, cunt, or twat to make you admit he's churning up more anger with his actions.Rush is our asshole. I don't condone what he said. You refuse to admit the truth because Obama's your asshole.
893	Please link to Obama calling Sarah Palin a "racist". A direct quote would be nice...For that matter, let's see any "angry rhetoric" that Obama has said about Sarah Palin.
894	you mean she's not trying to manipulate the election? not trying to make herself important as a politico? not making millions for revving up the "base"?if she doesn't want to be criticized, she really should find another line of work.i've never seen anyone in politics as thin-skinned as palin.she's like the schoolyard bully who trips the same kid walking past him every day and is flummoxed when that kid turns around and punches him in the face.i'm afraid my crocodile tears just won't flow for her.
895	Oh--Bullshit. There has never been a woman in politics that was so viciously attacked as Sarah Palin. Every single ethic charge the left launched at her was thrown out of court.What drives the left crazy is she is so honest. And she's certainly not a racist--and she has as much right to speak her mind as Fluke does or any woman for that matter without being a TARGET.How WEE---NY of Obama to use her in a campaign ad. He must have short man's syndrome--LOL. She isn't running for any office!
896	There is a strong implication in the timing of the flick "Game Change" being released around Super Tuesday that Obama and his team thought Palin would be involved in the election more than she is, and they still think so.All that didn't come to pass but the recent dust-up about contraception made it "a go" with the Palin add because "they" (the Obama agents) believe that Palin is despised by women generally and it is good strategy to undermine her power base any way they can.A brokered convention is possible as a result of the way delegates are proportionally allocated in the early races. If so it will include a roll for Palin, or so it would seem, and that possibility can't be lost on the Obama schemers.It may be that the so called movie (actually a propaganda hit piece) may inspire outcome opposit from what was planned. It may be seen for what it was and cause sympathy for Palin.
897	Oh--elephant shit! Celebutard Palin has hardly been attacked at all compared to the vicious insults CON$erviNutzis spew at Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi every day.Just a small sample:Hitlery ClintinHillary Rotten ClintonHildabeastHer ThighnessHillary "that buck-toothed witch, Satan."Men won't vote for Hillary Clinton because she reminds them of their nagging wives.This is Clinton's testicle lockbox. It is big enough for the entire Democrat hierarchy, not just some people in the media.She sounds like a screeching ex-wife. And -- and -- and I don't say that -- there's nothing against ex-wives or women. I'm just trying to be descriptive here for you.Men will know what I mean by this.will Americans want to sit around and watch a woman age that rapidly before their very eyes on television every day, as president of the United States?when Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear: Take out the garbage
898	You left out "Shrillary."And none of what you posted, edthesickdick, compares with "c*nt."
899	Shrillary does fit though.
900	Yes, there is:Thoughtcrime.
901	He is? Sorry, Charlie, he's a political commentator, just like Rush. But, that's different.
902	Flaming hypocrite.
903	Sorry but Celebutard Palin HERSELF has approved all of MessiahRushie's retard slurs, which he started long before Rahm emanuel!Are You Capable of Decency, Rahm Emanuel?February 1, 2010CELEBUTARD PALIN: Rahm’s slur on all God’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities – and the people who love them – is unacceptable, and it’s heartbreaking.February 4, 2010RUSH: I'm just going to read the definition of 'tard' to you in the Urban Dictionary.: "Adjective used to describe ones so retarded they do not deserve the r-e."February 8, 2010RUSH: The satire is easy. It's simply telling everybody who you really are and what you're really all about," and the left to this day still has no sense of humor. This business of Rahm Emanuel using "F-ing retarded " to describe his own radical leftist Democrats for getting in the way on health care and so forth... I never used the word. I never once used the word! It never crosses my mind to use the word.RUSH: So here is Rahm Emanuel stepping in it big time, and I thought I would just make fun of it. And you wouldn't believe the left out there thinks -- independently of Emanuel -- that I started using the word and that Sarah Palin should demand that I get fired, just like she did of EmanuelAugust 1, 2008RUSH: This ad's working. This ad's working. They're not going to throw him under the bus. He's exactly right. She looks at the term celebrity as a pejorative. See, they are so offended. That's why they're out there saying, "This is going to diminish McCain. This is going to make him look small in so many people's eyes." Wrong. It's correctly identifying Obama -- and his audience! His audience is a bunch of celebutards, and he's a celebutard, and they know it. If they are so concerned about how this is diminishing McCain, then they should ask McCain to keep doing these kind of commercials. If these commercials hurt McCain, why, they ought to be out there saying, "Great ads, Senator! You need to expand on this theme that Obama is nothing but a celebutard. "November 4, 2008RUSH: Well, it depends on the celebutard in order to answer this question. For example, Oprah. You look at Oprah. She's a billionaire, right?February 4, 2010RUSH: They're trying anything to get Sarah Palin. From Andrea Mitchell, NBC News, Washington, to everybody else at MSNBC and Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg, oh, they're all trying to get Sarah Palin to denounce me just as she did Rahm, and if she doesn't do it she's a hypocrite, they're saying. She knows that I do this kind of thing. Sarah Palin is a lifelong listener to this program.February 3, 2010RUSH: But our politically correct society is acting like some giant insult's taken place by calling a bunch of people who are "retards," "retards."RUSH: Now, Emanuel is taking his contrition one step farther -- hosting a delegation of advocates, including two people with mental disabilities, at the White House." They're going to have a "Retard" Summit just like they had the Beer Summit.February 7, 2010WALLACE: OK. But Rush Limbaugh weighed in this week. And he said this:"Our politically correct society is acting like some giant insult's taken place by calling a bunch of people who are retards, retards."CELEBUTARD PALIN: He was satirical (ph) in that --WALLACE: Wait a minute, let me finish.CELEBUTARD PALIN: OK.WALLACE: "I mean, these people, these liberal activists are kooks." Should Rush Limbaugh apologize?CELEBUTARD PALIN: They are kooks, so I agree with Rush Limbaugh.WALLACE: But you know what some people are going to say, Governor, and have said. They say, look, when it's her political adversary Rahm Emanuel, she's going to call him out, he's indecent, apologize. But when it's a political friend like Rush Limbaugh, oh it's satireCELEBUTARD PALIN: I didn't hear Rush Limbaugh calling a group of people whom he did not agree with "F-ing retards. " And we did know that Rahm Emanuel, it's been reported, did say that. That's a big difference there.February 16, 2010PALIN: He was using satire, using the 'r-word,' so he could bring to light what is was that Rahm Emanuel was calling other people
904	You really haven't been paying attention to Obama,m have you?
905	Obama Does The Unthinkabl: Names Andrew Lorenz-Strait--1st Illegal Alien Amnesty Czar
906	This post was written by Mudslinger.
907	This post was written on 2012-03-13T19:31:00.
908	This is bad. This is very bad for America. He will be the first illegal alien amnesty czar as the point man between the Presidents office and illegal aliens. In other words he will be a lobbyist for illegals and the president brushed Congress aside with this move and lawmakers are not happy. Also, where is the media on this story?
909	Obama should be considered a enemy to our country
910	Obama sees millions of votes coming from the illegal aliens that he grants immediate citizenship. That is ALL he sees in them. He doesn't give a rats ass about them with exception of gaining votes for big government.Obama is absolutely THE most unethical, dishonest, anti-American President we have EVER had!To hell with Obama and all of his faithful, Kool-aid drinking followers. (You people are fucking SICK!)Try reading the Constitution of the United States. If you do not agree with the provisions therein, try another country....like Cuba.
911	What does the constitution say about keeping people out?
912	Nothing.But it does say illegal aliens are entitled to due process rights, consequently the Administrations action comports with that requirement.
913	your source spelled the guys name wrong.
914	Ron Paul Wins First Caucus: MSM Changes Rules, Reports Romney Wins
915	This post was written by Robodoon.
916	This post was written on 2012-03-12T09:05:00.
917	Comment: More MSM working for the NWO and the end of the USA.
918	So wait, Romney got more delegates than did Dr. Paul?You mean Romney won?What was your point again?
919	Has teh MSM been reporting the delegates won up until now, instead of the popular vote win?the answer is....no. It's been about the popular vote win. Now, it's about delegates. Will ron paul win any contests? Here is one, but the delegate rules for V.I are complex and Romney got the GOP delegate pledge, so Romney gets the headline.The point is, no matter what, ron paul is the loser. If he grabs more delegates, he didnt win the popular vote and is guilty of stacking delegates. If he wins the popular vote in a contest, he lost the delegates to the pledge GOP and therefore, did not win.He always loses according to the media.
920	The worst part is it's only the fucking virgin islands. God forbid they even mention he wins a TERRITORY.But it is pretty funny though. All the sudden the popular vote means nothing
921	Yup. He's not a Big Government Globalist. Therefore he'll always lose.
922	Only if Paul wins it it doesn't deserve a headline. Up until now, it's been ALL about the popular vote. Now it's about delegates for the winner. people dont care. it's a pony show Romney took the ribbon on from the very start.They will change the goal posts no matter what to marginalize Paul. Anyone who supports Paul knows this already. It's even better when they simply cheat in order to fuck ron over when they can't beat him fair and square.
923	The Big Government Globalists from both Parties like things just the way are. They don't ever want to see things change. And they'll do or say anything to make sure the status-quo is preserved. That should be pretty obvious to anyone with common sense. It is very sad but it is what it is.
924	things will c hange when these establishment types break the US piggy bank. Probably not for the better though.Congrats on your special generation lost.
925	So Romney gets more delegates and yet somehow Paul won? How does that work?Doesnt seem to help Ron Paul's Delegate strategy.
926	the media is corporate people
927	Yes, Romney won the GOP pledged delegates. Big shocker. Paul won the popular vote, which up until this particualr contest, has been the basis for all news reporting on winners adn losers. The popular vote. Now it is about delegates. If you can't see how moving the goal posts for marginalization purposes is relevant, then I suppose you'll lap up whatever they tell you to lap up.Vote for your favorit corporatist liar, or the current socialist. Makes no difference at this point.
928	We're pointing out the irony of the MSM. Every contest up until this, it's been about who won the popular vote, and that Paul hasn't been able to do that in any of them. Now that he finally does, they pretend the popular vote isn't the important aspect, but who won the delegates...which is odd, considering Paul has been winning a majority in many of the caucus states.Please tell me you recognize this.
929	How are people not seeing this? You'd have to have a lobe removed to be that stupid.
930	So what's your point? That CONz are lying stealing cheating scum? Or that the LIBERAL media is at fault?
931	Can any of you name a single state that wasnt called for the person who won the most delegates?
932	Iiowa. Right off the bat.
933	Iowa, Maine, Missouri, Washington.....
934	Yeah.All the caucus states.
935	Minnesota, Colorado, Alaska, and Nevada as well.
936	Let me guess, Paul really won them all?
937	People are dumb.
938	Noone has and Noone wil until the state conventions but Paul supporters have been selected as the majority of delegates in a lot of counties in these states and they will elect from among themselves for delegates to the National Convention.
939	At the precinct level, yes.That doesn't necessarily mean he wins the majority of the states' delegates that go to national, but it puts him in the best position to win the most possible.For example, if Paul wins 75% of delegates in the precincts of a specific county, then he has a significantly better chance of winning the next slate of delegates chosen at the county's convention. This in turn sends the majority of delegates on to the state convention, where the final slate of delegates is chosen to represent that state at the national convention. So winning majority delegates at precinct level basically gives you a huge advantage over your opponents, because delegate selection is majority based at the conventions.
940	Owned.
941	This is what blind support for a candidate looks like people... Just say something and hope you're right.Mitt won't beat Obama btw, he can't get people to show up... There is a massive anti Mitt vote even when Mitt will be the winner and situations like this involving Mitt and Paul here and in Maine will make Paul supporters NOT vote for Mitt.
942	Both delegate counts and popular vote counts should have been reported. I did read one article that listed both. Much of the media is becoming more FOXNews like-RUSH to report some facts, ignore others.
943	Figures Avatar didn't respond further after the caucus delegate situation was explained.
944	Why would Avatar do that?That would mean giving concession to us by admitting it is media bias against Paul. Which would make one have to start actually learning about the rules of the game and not drone zombie media soundbitess, and could make one realize that the game is rigged. Which would probably not sit nicely into the boxed in thinking of most people.
945	Well he constantly ridicules Paul for his earmark position, and I've probably explained the position at least 3 or 4 different times and everytime he never responds further, but will show up in a different Paul thread at another time and continue to criticize him on it.I think he just retreats when he doesn't like the answer.
946	That's a normal response from folks who suffer from severe cognitive dissonance.
947	Well DANG! I mean C'Mon the guy took the Virgin Islands!!! How can he NOT be the nominee?
948	Why are not his popular vote tallies reported as NEWS? In 2000, electors/popular vote was discussed at length.
949	Not-so-independent logic there. it isn't about the nominee. It's about fair journalist practices and reporting the events without displaying a deliberate bias. Something our media has shown us they can not do time and time again.
950	************************************************** *******Another speech by Santorum.
951	Looking like the choice? It was decided before the primary even began. Still that has zero to do with the integrity of independent journalists reporting the news as it happens. Why not just say Obama wins in November now since he's looking like the United States of Amnesia's CHOICE?Save us all some time and king him now.I guess this idea of journalist integrity really is lost on most people. Oh, well.
952	You mean you give a cop out that that really doesnt address the fact that it's a completely dishonest tactic.
953	You're seriously going to tell me that Paul is winning the delegates at the caucuses?
954	Ah. Well as far as that goes, the press has been EXTREMELY unfair to Ron Paul from the start. I don't dispute that at all.But it's not like the guy ever had any real chance at the nomination anyway.
955	Is nothing more than you showing just how not-so-independent your logic is. It;'s repeating MSM soundbites of marginalization. Congrats on your special not-so-independence in logic.
956	You APaulcolytes are funny. Paul never had a chance and all your whining about it, doesn't change that. He has tried this how many times? He has come in first in how many primaries?But I get it. Your definition of an Independent is someone who agrees with you. Your definition of logic is agreeing with you. I see it from "internet people" all the time.Ron Paul is truly great in some ways but when he f-ks up, he does it big time. And he does it often.The other thing APaulcolytes can't seem to handle or accept as reality is this: The majority of Americans simply don't want what your guy or Libertarians have to offer.Time to go into denial or do the usual "You hate liberty! You're a statist! You're Establishment!" or whatever flavor of tantrum suits you.
957	No, my definition of independent logic is someone who doesn't attempt to pigeon hole a situation based on media soundbites like you're doing here.Paul has just as much of a chance as the others should the playing field be equal. But it isn't. It's rigged. Both in the primary/caucus and in the media representation of the events.Now you want to call me some sort of name to deflect the FACT your logic isn't independent.Congrats. How original.
958	Nah. I'd just point out that your guy has well, more than 3 delegates anyway. But it's all rigged!No it's not. Your guy sucks. I mean he's great when he's great but that doesn't change the fact that the majority of America doesn't want him or what Libertarianism has to offer.Oh wait! I could be wrong! How many Libertarian presidents have there been? Oops. Well how many Libertarian Senators and Cogressmen?Wait! SinceLibertarianism is so great, I'm sure LOTS of countries have chosen it as the model for their government! Which are the five best examples?Hmmm. yeah that.
959	Still that has zero to do with the integrity of independent journalists reporting the news as it happens.*************************************The news tends to FOLLOW THE LEADERS.
960	Yeah, and what Peach points out.What a kook this hipster know it all must be in the real world.
961	The point is BOTH sides work for the same MASTERS!!
962	Who are?
963	but Romney told us that corporations are people, so the media are people. Just like Soylent green. So the media is soylent green!But seriously, I never watch TV news anymore. American TV News is about as dumbed down as it gets.
964	The MEGA-Corporations that run the government. You've got Cargill and Monsanto in control of our food, you've got Raytheon, GE and Halliburton in charge of the Military, you've got Sony, Clear Channel and Disney in charge of ALL your input (TV, radio, movies, news) You've got Goldman-Sachs and Citibank in charge of the money.Wake the hell up!!
965	Win or not I really don't see a Ron Paul surge to the top in the near or distant future.
966	Take it for what it is................
967	Nice dodge of the questions.How many Libertarians have been voted into national office again? Yeah that. How many governments are Libertarian? Yeah, I'd dodge that one too if I were you.So then you believe that Ron Paul has actually won all the delegates but the Ming the Merciless has rigged it all. Remind me to buy aluminum futures later. If there are a lot of whackjobs out there wearing hats made out tinfoil and hiding in mom's basement, it might be a good investment.Or hey! There is that reality place! You know, the one the rest of us live in? Yeah that one. So you can babble on all you want but if you think the majority of Americans want Ron Paul, you're smokin' what you're rollin'.You may now continue ranting about how everyone else is wrong and Ron Paul is actually adored by the majority of American voters...
968	There hasn't been a female president either so I guess by your "Independent" logic they aren't worthy either. Just because something hasn't been achieved doesn't mean it isn't worth striving for.Oh and you don't speak for everyone and everyone isn't wrong.....just you. Sorry to break it to you. Paul has polled strongly against Obama and one poll recently showed him beating Obama by more than Romney would. So actually many people do like Dr. Paul.
969	I never said anything about what most Americans want. That was YOU who claimed to have the insider knowledge to project such an assertion, asshat. i also never said Ron Paul has X amount of delegates. You're either a full blown fucking moron (the likely scenario) or the one smokin' what you're rollin' (definitely the crack, since I've known P*t smokers that can sit around all day puffin' and make more sense than your blathering on about nothing).I could give a flying shit what other countries of the world do when it comes to their governments. That is not only a NONissue here, it's a horrible attempt to try and move the subject to be about libertarians instead of about deliberate media bias.Keep making shit up there, guy. But make NO mistake, you're thinking is neither independent, nor logical. You should stick to PBRs, tight jeans and LPs.
970	Yes. I've read news stories from local news outlets and watched countless video being taken at various different conventions in the caucus states and Paul is in fact winning a lot of delegates. He's got an overwhelming majority in Nevada, for instance.
971	"Everybody KNOWS..." is not a valid or factual argument.Grow up!
972	How low has the Paul crowd gotten when they are screaming for a victory in one of the smallest delegate contests of the election? His first that would be!
973	How low has the media gotten in their marginalizing of Paul to take such a tiny win away from him in the news and hand it to Mitt Romney?I think you miss the point here.
974	And another space cadet is heard from...The subject is media bias and voter fraud/disenfranchisement. What you idiots don't think about when you parrot this shit is that if they can do it to Ron Paul 2 elections in a row, they can do it to YOUR guy the next fucking time!!
975	Well considering that they probably vote for whoever the MSM media tells them to it probably won't happen to them. You are rewarded with being right when you agree with the masters.
976	You yourself made a thread about how Paul hasn't won anything yet and you feel sorry for him.Now he wins something and you're making fun of us for calling out the media bias in regards to it?
977	Ah. A reasonable reply. I have no problem with Ron Paul - I actually like much about him. But some of his followers are complete whackjobs - like the guy who started launching insults (which I don't initiate but I do return) because I dared dispute his holy messiah could possibly be behind in the delegates, and Evil Ming the Merciless has rigged every primary in every state and so on... You do not seem to be "You're not voting for my guy so you hate freedom, you *@/##^*!!!!" type of Ron Paul supporter.I have no doubt about RP doing well here, in Nevada. I have met more Libertarians since moving here, than anywhere I've ever lived. I can easily acknowledge that Ron Paul has many delegates but do the majority of Americans want him as president? No. If they did, the Libertarian party would be as big or bigger than the Dem or GOP parties. But it's not. It's just that simple. So who knows? Maybe Paul should have more delegates than are currently on the board but there is no way in hell that he would be in the lead.
978	I don't think anyone is saying Ron Paul is in the lead right now. Who can say what might have happened had things gone differently in Iowa though. There have been several states where the results are questionable and appearances matter to the masses. What if the media gave him the attention it gives the others? Again who can say how public opinion might be influenced by that? When you say that the american people don't want Ron Paul to be President maybe you are right but shouldn't the playing field be equal so they are given a fair chance to decide? The american people are being manipulated and this election cycle is a glaring testimony to that fact.
979	Yes it should be a level playing field.The American people are always being manipulated and have been long before this election cycle.
980	How come Ron Paul can't win over more Republicans? Santorum, Romney and Newt all got 30 and Ron Paul got 8%? How come Ron Paul supporters can't win over more Republicans? You can't blame the media. Everyone has gotten a good look at Ron Paul and pretty much made up their minds. What is it that Republicans don't like about Ron Paul?And Ron Paul fans. Stop arguing with us liberals if you can't even convince conservatives you are sane. The only things we like about Ron Paul, the conservatives hate. Go figure that one out?But I do notice that Ron Paul supporters and Mitt supporters rarely argue about their differences.Here is what they avoid discussing. Ron Paul fans admit the bankers are corrupt. But they don't seem to understand that so too are the other mega corporations and billionaires that run our country. Groups like ALEC now write our legislation. Citizens United. What do Ron Paulers think about Citizens United? I bet not much. All they ever seem to say when I mention the Koch brothers or the Adelman is LESS REGULATIONS. Without much thought behind the talking point.What do Ron Paulers think about lobbyists? Its eems like less regulations is the cure all for everything. Doesn't make sense to anyone. Well, 92% of Republicans don't agree with him. That's enough for me.Its not just the bankers that are the problem, its the oil ceo's and healthcare ceo's and Mitt Romney Bain Capitals and NAFTA and Free Unfair trade and tax breaks to the rich that bankrupted this country.Oh, and Ron Paul'ers also understand the corrupt Military Industrial Complex. I give them that one too. Another reason why Republicans don't like Paul. They love war. They love military spending but not social security. That's unconstitutional.

984	I will never vote democrat again, I don't give a shit who it is. they are corrupt to their corps..
985	I don't think this is "criminal". It may violate civil code of some sort but there is no criminal offense here.
986	from the article.....
987	I had forgotten how this thing works about giving credits and taking credits from the little light meter up there.Willow, I was only pointing out that this is probably not a criminal offense. The violation, according to the article, is the fact these recordings didn't properly identify themselves. At least not to the satisfaction of the person writing the article. This writer claims that because he doesn't know who "The 99% Womens Group" (or who ever these people are) is, that this violates the regulation that robocalls must identify who is sponsoring the call. It's just really thin to begin with and in addition, I don't see where any kind of charges have been made, much less has anyone been been convicted of anything and even if that were the case, it's not something covered by "criminal" code. We don't generally refer to speeders as criminals. Or any number of civil infractions or misdemeanors. Had the author of this topic said "illegal activity" then I wouldn't have raised a peep. But "criminal" is just misleading. No criminal offense here.
988	And that's a very thin statement to base a judgement of illegal on, much less criminal. The group did identify itself, the author just claims there is no known group by that name. Well.... known to whom?If the group can be identified by this name, there is nothing even illegal, much less criminal.
989	The letter of the law is the letter of the law. The spirit of the law was long killed off by the left as unimportant.
990	They have to be incorporated somewhere. They have to have at least of 503(c) application on file. And the failure to provide the callback number is defined as illegal. It may be a misdemeanor instead of a felony, but it is still illegal.You note from the article that they block access to the return phone number.They are definitely in breach of laws on fun raising too, if no one knows of them.
991	I don't disagree with you. I'm actually holding you to the letter of the law and this isn't criminal. It's not a criminal violation anymore than a parking ticket is a criminal violation. We separate criminal code and civil code for a reason. The letter of the law says this isn't a criminal offense. Your title is misleading. No crime here. No criminals. Perhaps some "violators".
992	And I wouldn't dispute any of that, if it turns out to be the case.But it's still not "criminal". That's just inflamatory hyperbole.
993	That explains it.
994	Ergo, criminal activity.
995	No one has been even formally accused of anything, much less convicted. There is no criminal conduct here that has been even remotely verified. The group may very well have a 501 app pending. We just don't know. Calling this criminal is just inflamatory hyperbole, at the least, premature.
996	So are reps.
997	Ah, the "honesty" of the left is apparent.
998	Left Now Engaged in Criminal Activity to Silence RushMore criminal than sending your maid out with a shoe box full of cash to by street Oxyconton?More criminal than trying to smuggle hundreds of Viagra pills past customs?The PigMan is fucking lucky he is STILL not in prison like anybody else would be in Florida with such offenses.
999	You make good points but I'm not sure all this digging up of bones helps out. Don't get me wrong, I don't care for Rush but I think it's wise to judge incidents on their individual merits. The fact that these calls were about Rush shouldn't have any bearing on their standing as compliant / non compliant with the regs on these things. If they are a violation or even "criminal" as our poster suggest, that should not be based in any way upon the subject matter of the call.
