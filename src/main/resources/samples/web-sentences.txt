 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	3	345	351	Hello! 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	4	353	453	I've used GWO in the past with my clients, but I've never tried using it to track affiliate links.  
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	5	454	529	Meaning, I have a link on my page that goes to a website on another domain. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	6	530	604	If someone clicks the link, it should be registered as a conversion event. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	7	606	689	I've research this a bit, and found a few posts describing some sort of a solution. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	8	691	713	I came upon this code: 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	9	715	754	&lt;script&gt; if(typeof(urchinTracker)!
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	10	755	855	='function')document.write('&lt;sc'+'ript src=&quot;'+ 'http'+(document.location.protocol=='https:'?'
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	11	856	958	s://ssl':'://www')+ '.google-analytics.com/urchin.js'+' &quot;&gt;&lt;/sc'+'ript&gt;') &lt;/script&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	12	960	1196	&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Click on this link&lt;a href=http:// www.blah.com/payme onclick=&quot;_uacct=' UA-XXXXXXX-X'; urchinTracker('/ XXXXXXXXX/goal'); return true;&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;!
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	13	1197	1221	&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	14	1223	1307	I can see how it's using an onClick event, but I wasn't sure how that ties into GWO. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	15	1309	1530	For example, here's the link I want to track &lt;a href=&quot;http:// www.keywordresearching.com/recommends/keycompete &quot; onClick=&quot;javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/ keycompete/');&quot;&gt;KeyCompete&lt;/a&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	16	1532	1615	I'm already using that link to track onClick events as a Goal for Google Analytics. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	17	1617	1642	Now I want to tie in GWO. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	18	1644	1654	Any ideas? 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	19	1656	1663	Thanks!

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	3	298	310	Hi everyone! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	4	312	343	First off, I want to apologize. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	5	344	469	I've had some trouble with my money flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable net connection yet. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	6	470	543	Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my attention in the real world. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	7	544	682	So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to work on the firmware for real. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	8	684	758	So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll call. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	9	759	813	Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	10	814	831	What's happening? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	11	832	914	If you want to help or think you can help in any way shape or form, please say so. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	12	915	980	And as for you guys, have you been doing some research and stuff?

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	14	1002	1004	;) 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	15	1006	1146	Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting time! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	16	1147	1219	I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against that idea? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	17	1221	1305	I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys are. :) Seeya! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	18	1439	1522	I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in the way. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	19	1523	1600	This project is taking much longer than I had ever expected, but that's okay. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	20	1601	1687	We'll get there eventually as long as we don't give up on this common dream of ours ;)

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	9	836	954	Right now things are going slow, mostly due to real life issues for me and the fact that we're such a small community. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	10	955	1014	I'm hoping that I can pick up the pace in October sometime. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	11	1015	1208	Right now we haven't made too many decisions, nothing is set in stone, but the general idea is to develop a firmware that is capable of running OpenGL/AL and OIS (Object-oriented Input System). 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	12	1209	1369	On top of that we'll put something we call the &quot;HomeUI&quot;, which is essentially a few modules with the same generic GUI, and we'll develop it in Python. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	13	1371	1450	Hopefully, this will take around six months to complete once I can get started. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	14	1451	1491	We're happy with any help we can get. :)

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	4	311	342	First off, I want to apologize. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	5	343	468	I've had some trouble with my money flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable net connection yet. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	6	469	542	Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my attention in the real world. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	7	543	681	So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to work on the firmware for real. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	8	683	757	So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll call. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	9	758	812	Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	10	813	830	What's happening? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	11	831	913	If you want to help or think you can help in any way shape or form, please say so. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	12	914	979	And as for you guys, have you been doing some research and stuff?

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	15	1005	1145	Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting time! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	16	1146	1218	I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against that idea? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	17	1220	1304	I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys are. :) Seeya! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	18	1448	1531	I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in the way.

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	4	318	428	- My name is Joe Herbert and I have been very active in gaming and computer technology sense I was very young. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	5	429	658	I have graduated WarenTech (jefferson county vocational school) with a certification in Computer Programming and Technology and have worked as a professional QA Tech (tester) on several Activision game projects (still under NDA). 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	6	659	760	Several years ago a friend and I had begun taking notes and writing up plans for just such a project! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	7	761	814	We unfortunately allowed ourselves to get destracted. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	8	815	869	We did not think we were ready for a project proposal. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	9	870	965	I was amazed when I learned that we were not the only ones to think of an open gaming platform. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	10	966	1236	I would like to do what i can to help this project get going and would love to share some of the ideas that i had come upwith, aswell as some of the issues (that i have not seen addressed on the wiki) that i had faced when trying to come up with my own plans for an OGC. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	11	1238	1279	- I look forward to working with you all!

 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	3	321	327	David, 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	4	329	379	I just read your post on embedding rdf in xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	5	380	458	I like where you're going, but I'm skeptical about embedding rdf with xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	6	459	583	Microformats seem to scratch an itch for designers, and designers tend to have the power to get them released on their site. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	7	585	867	When the source is a backend that's already capable of creating rdf formatted data, I'd imagine a discoverable link within the xhtml would be better...something similar to auto discovered RSS, operator would recognize a div/span and be redirected to the end point that provides RDF. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	8	869	947	The problem with OWL/RDF is that it isn't well specified for common domains.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	9	948	1003	Take for example the ical ontology posted on the w3c.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	10	1004	1199	Load that up into Protege and it doesn't even recognize the date fields as dates, they aren't specified as 'functional' and allow multiple entries...you cannot have an event start at two times.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	11	1200	1302	It's just a really poor example of owl, and yet, that's supposed to be the OWL version of vCalendar.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	12	1303	1340	The microformat standard is better.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	13	1341	1413	Go ahead, load this up in Protege http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical .  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	14	1414	1492	Even if we want to share our data, it's not clear what ontology we should use! 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	15	1494	1672	At the spring semweb conference in San Jose somebody gave a talk on embedding rdf in Atom...at first I thought that it was an odd idea, but he's right, it's a really good idea.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	16	1673	1717	Google is using Atom for it's open social.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	17	1718	1930	So the XHTML would frame a region and point the plugin to the rdf endpoint, and it'd probably be best to deliver it via Atom...which I think would allow the rdf to be more normal, regular rdf, as opposed to RDFa. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	18	2065	2233	My (small) dissappointment in Microformats is really that they force you to use a kind of pre-defined structure (basically templates) to make the data machine-readable. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	19	2234	2383	That's fine when we are talking about vCards, or address specifications, but what if I wish to to do same for food, or movies, books or other topics. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	20	2384	2444	You'd need a microformat specification for each one of them. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	21	2445	2593	A common syntax to express ontological data would allow us to overcome these limitations, as you can somehow separate meaning versus representation. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	22	2594	2904	I do agree OWL has it's limitations (for one that has been addressed by OWL 1.1; cfr an earlier post of mine: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tag/2006-September/000171.html ), but currently I know of no other ontology language that has (being xml / RDF based) to possibility to integrate with web content. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	23	2905	3081	One thing I am thinking of is that you could markup sections of text with reference to an ontology class they are referring to, and more or less forget about advanced relating. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	24	3082	3446	Very Rudimentary example: &lt;div instanceof=&quot;someontology#address&quot;&gt; &lt;span instanceof=&quot;someontology#street&quot;&gt;some street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span instanceof=&quot;someontology#country&quot;&gt;France&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; By reasoning over the tagged classes the relations could be extracted by itself and a template might be generated. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	25	3447	3830	I must agree this thought is quite primitive at the moment, and yes, there still should be a reference ontology to which you refer (although if you abstract it you might try and let go explicit ontology references in the above examples (instanceof=&quot;street&quot;, instanceof=&quot;country&quot; etc) and let an application that works with the data disambiguate the meaning of it. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	26	3831	3863	All very hypothetical of course. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	27	3865	4102	In the case of the ical example, I believe it would be better if the rdf:datatype would be made explicit as xsd:date-time (instead of integer as it is now), and if I am correct the property should be declared as datatypeproperty as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	28	4103	4223	So there might be some design imperfections, and perhaps correcting these might lead to a better recognition in Protege. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	29	4224	4353	It just shows that OWL is not very accessible to many (and also got me puzzled now and then) and is really still in it's infancy. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	30	4355	4578	Perhaps putting RDF into Atom feeds would allow you to achieve certain things, but in my opinion the direct tagging of content with semantic classes, although very impractical, might definately have some advantages as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	31	4580	4887	I wrote the article (in the same way that I use the website) to try and explore some ideas I have, whether embedding OWL in XHTML will or will not be a mainstream, the fact that it is possible already got me (and I hope others) thinking, and we all know the semantic web requires a serious push in the back.

 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	37	5031	5086	&gt; I just read your post on embedding rdf in xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	38	5087	5170	I like where you're &gt; going, but I'm skeptical about embedding rdf with xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	39	5171	5305	Microformats &gt; seem to scratch an itch for designers, and designers tend to have the &gt; power to get them released on their site. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	40	5307	5614	&gt; When the source is a backend that's already capable of creating rdf &gt; formatted data, I'd imagine a discoverable link within the xhtml would &gt; be better...something similar to auto discovered RSS, operator would &gt; recognize a div/span and be redirected to the end point that provides &gt; RDF. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	41	5616	5704	&gt; The problem with OWL/RDF is that it isn't well specified for common &gt; domains.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	42	5705	5760	Take for example the ical ontology posted on the w3c.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	43	5761	5971	Load &gt; that up into Protege and it doesn't even recognize the date fields as &gt; dates, they aren't specified as 'functional' and allow multiple &gt; entries...you cannot have an event start at two times.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	44	5972	6084	It's just a &gt; really poor example of owl, and yet, that's supposed to be the OWL &gt; version of vCalendar.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	45	6085	6122	The microformat standard is better.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	46	6123	6200	Go ahead, &gt; load this up in Protege http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical .  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	47	6201	6284	Even if &gt; we want to share our data, it's not clear what ontology we should use! 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	48	6286	6479	&gt; At the spring semweb conference in San Jose somebody gave a talk on &gt; embedding rdf in Atom...at first I thought that it was an odd idea, &gt; but he's right, it's a really good idea.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	49	6480	6529	Google is using Atom for &gt; it's open social.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	50	6530	6760	So the XHTML would frame a region and point the &gt; plugin to the rdf endpoint, and it'd probably be best to deliver it &gt; via Atom...which I think would allow the rdf to be more normal, &gt; regular rdf, as opposed to RDFa. "> 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	51	6868	7595	i have been thinking for some time about a use case where i use rdfa to mark up extensive web-based lectures for students. this would require creating an ontology for the course topic which may at first be problematic but may well be adopted by publishers if successful. this would allow reasoning and relationships between the lecture, the course discussions, assessments such as carefully structured multiple guess, and other course elements. your article is very interesting to me with reference to this project. these kinds of applications of rdfa are not directly related to data exchange (at least at first), but allow the semantic web to be used to create content and then actually use that content outside the web page. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	52	7730	7794	That is exactly the kind of use-case I'm having in mind as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	53	7795	7871	And true, it would require an ontology about your domain of discourse first. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	54	7872	8123	On top of that particular usecase of RDfa, having the ontology content easily accessible (and hence, easily referencable) would promote the use of it, which in my opinion provides arguments for publishing the ontology within regular web pages as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	55	8124	8476	Publishing the ontology within web pages would could also make it more transparant to the user and thereby let him understand the content better, that is something you will never achieve by just looking at the OWL syntax (or any other syntax you express your ontology in), which by definition facilitates machine-readability, not human understanding....
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	56	8477	8661	(For a concrete example: any concept page of http://ontologyonline.org versus the owl syntax that can also be shown when selecting the 'Show OWL syntax' option present on those pages).

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	6	496	551	I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	7	552	772	A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of cash within weeks with only an initial investment of $5.00!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	8	773	888	So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must  be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	15	1264	1346	All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	16	1347	1469	You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups.

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	18	1493	1515	No catch, that was it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	19	1516	1604	So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	20	1605	1673	I figured, what have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	21	1674	1770	Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	22	1771	1804	So I checked it out with the U.S. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	23	1805	1877	Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	33	2340	2381	It's certainly worth $5.00, and 5 stamps.

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	82	6140	6194	So then I made $5.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	83	6195	6378	Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5, and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	84	6379	6511	Then those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4, and only 5 replies to each, and I will bring in an additional $125.00!

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	106	8107	8204	At first I was to scared to try this, but once I researched it, I found that it is totally legal.

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	4	370	456	&quot; Turn $5.00 into $42,000, WITH HARDLY ANY WORK.... read this to find out how!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	5	457	496	READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	6	497	552	I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	7	553	773	A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of cash within weeks with only an initial investment of $5.00!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	8	774	889	So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must  be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	9	890	964	Before you get skeptical, just take a few minutes to fishish reading this. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	10	965	1050	WITH THIS PLAN, YOU REALLY CAN MAKE TONS OF TOTALLY LEGAL, FAST AND EASY CASH MONEY!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	11	1051	1062	IT WORKS!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	12	1063	1145	BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT CAREFULLY FOR IT TO WORK CORRECTLY AND IN YOUR FAVOR!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	13	1146	1243	WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU ARE GONNA MAKE, YOU WILL SOON GET EVERTHING YOU'VE  ALWAYS DREAMED OF!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	14	1244	1264	Here's how it works. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	15	1265	1347	All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	16	1348	1470	You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	17	1471	1493	(There are thousands.) 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	18	1494	1516	No catch, that was it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	19	1517	1605	So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	20	1606	1674	I figured, what have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	21	1675	1771	Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	22	1772	1805	So I checked it out with the U.S. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	23	1806	1878	Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	24	1879	1912	Then I invested the measly $5.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	25	1913	1934	Well, GUESS WHAT!!... 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	26	1935	1986	Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	27	1987	2001	I was shocked! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	28	2002	2065	I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	29	2066	2104	In my first week, I made about $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	30	2105	2169	By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	31	2170	2230	In the third week I had over $10,000 and it's still growing. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	32	2231	2340	This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	33	2341	2382	It's certainly worth $5.00, and 5 stamps. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	34	2383	2457	By the way, I have spent more than that on the lottery in the last month!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	35	2458	2639	Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you  need it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	36	2641	2768	STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	37	2769	2823	&quot; Also, be sure to include your name and address. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	38	2824	2974	Now, get 5 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope, to prevent thievery. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	39	2975	3038	Next, place one paper in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	40	3039	3172	You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	41	3173	3222	What you are doing is creating a service by this. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	42	3223	3248	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	72	5420	5448	Congratulations...THAT'S IT! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	73	5449	5514	All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	74	5515	5598	After you get the hang of it, it will only take about 30 seconds for each posting!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	75	5599	5673	**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	76	5674	5727	---BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	77	5728	5793	You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	78	5794	5832	You may eventually want to rent a P.O. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	79	5833	5886	Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	80	5887	5994	If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postal service will deliver it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	81	5995	6140	**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT** ----Now the WHY part---- Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	82	6141	6195	So then I made $5.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	83	6196	6379	Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5, and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	84	6380	6512	Then those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4, and only 5 replies to each, and I will bring in an additional $125.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	85	6513	6663	Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, and I will make an additional $625.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	86	6664	6693	OK, now here is the fun part. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	87	6694	6835	Each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2, and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	88	6836	7010	Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1, and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react, I will receive an amazing $15,625,00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	89	7011	7053	With an original investment of only $5.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	90	7054	7062	AMAZING! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	91	7063	7241	When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $5.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5 again. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	92	7242	7267	Then start posting again.

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	97	7488	7574	People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	98	7575	7583	So what!
