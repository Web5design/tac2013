Will US Troops Fire On US Citizens?

[With recent reports that Homeland Security has ordered the delivery of 450,000,000 hollow point bullets for its use, more than one bullet for every man woman and child alive today in this country, with Barack Obama, the Office Of White House Communications, mediamatters, and especially MSNBC's Al Sharpton busily trying to orchestrate and foment a Race War bringing about Barack's very own "Reichstag Fire Moment" when he can suspend the Constitution and remove the irritation, chafing and constraints the Bill of Rights places upon him, this is a pertinent question.]

"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizens?

The question of troop involvement in a possible upcoming Martial Law scenario that is being predicted is no imaginary possibility  nor is it a conspiracy theory.

Many readers will recall the survey given to U.S. Marines at the 29 Palms Marine Corps base in California.

The survey asked the respondents to consider the following statement: I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.

The current situation is even more alarming, for example:

The passing of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which THEBLAZE covers in an article titled, Can the Indefinite Detention Bill Send Americans to Military Prison Without Trial? (12-08-11) has caused even the most skeptic to be concerned for their personal safety  especially those fighting for liberty.

The National Defense Resources Preparedness: Comparing Previous Executive Orders article that theintelhub.com posted online is another example of the emergence of a Fascist Police State taking complete control.

Lastly, the purchase by the Department of Homeland Security of 450,000,000 rounds of ammunition over a five year period should be warning enough that something is definitely wrong.

Who are these rounds to be used on? Even at 80,000,000 rounds per year, thats one bullet for every dissenter at a minimum."

As incompetent as Janet Reno was, she wasn't responsible for Waco, any more than the attorney general of the time was responsible for Jonestown.

When these kinds of "I am God" cults form, everyone who joins is already dead. They are just waiting for the order. Eventually these madmen demand that their followers die to prove their belief and devotion. Waco is no different from Jonestown or from Heaven's Gate.

Quite possibly; but, what IF this or any other president decides to say, suspend the constitution-what then? Crawl, or take a side? All I know, is that the oath I took was to the constitution, not the country, not the president, not the army, so I guess that would put me on the side opposing anyone who suspended or violated it.

Every military member in every service is taught in basic training to obey lawful orders, failure to do so means a punitive action can be taken against you, up to and including a court-martial and a possible prison term, depending on the circumstances. But the key word in all that is LAWFUL; the military are not expected to be automatons, indiscriminately killing somebody just cuz somebody else told 'em to.

Should the military be called on in cases of emergency to quell violence and restore order, I am certain that the rules of engagement will be clear, and everyone will know what to do under whatever the circumstances might be. Every soldier will know that, so if the situation demands it they will do their duty. If that means firing on US citizens, then yes, they will do it.

Probably much more than you do because I pay attention.

<a href="http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,121278,00.html">Military may Recruit Foreigners</a>

And since Sept. 11, 2001, the number of immigrants in uniform who have become U.S. citizens has increased from 750 in 2001 to almost 4,600 last year, according to military statistics.

With severe manpower strains because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and a mandate to expand the overall size of the military -- the Pentagon is under pressure to consider a variety of proposals involving foreign recruits, according to a military affairs analyst.

<a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/2011/fbi-says-gangs-infiltrating-the-us-military.html">FBI Says Gangs Infiltrating the US Military</a>

The U.S. military is facing a "significant criminal threat" from gangs, including prison and biker gangs, whose members have found their way into the ranks, according to an FBI-led investigation.

Some gang members get into the military to escape the streets, but then end up reconnecting once in, while others target the services specifically for the combat and weapons training, the National Gang Intelligence Center says in a just-released 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment/Emerging Trends.

Thank you for this opportunity to educate you since you won't do it yourself.

With severe manpower strains because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and a mandate to expand the overall size of the military -- the Pentagon is under pressure to consider a variety of proposals involving foreign recruits, according to a military affairs analyst.

<a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/2011/fbi-says-gangs-infiltrating-the-us-military.html">FBI Says Gangs Infiltrating the US Military</a>

The U.S. military is facing a "significant criminal threat" from gangs, including prison and biker gangs, whose members have found their way into the ranks, according to an FBI-led investigation.

Some gang members get into the military to escape the streets, but then end up reconnecting once in, while others target the services specifically for the combat and weapons training, the National Gang Intelligence Center says in a just-released 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment/Emerging Trends.

Thank you for this opportunity to educate you since you won't do it yourself.

FYI - the military does allow non-citizens to enlist in the military. But they must attain citizenship or they cannot re-enlist, and so their influence is quite minimal. And let me say this further about them and the gangbangers and such: the military has some bad people in it, as we've seen in the news every so often. Most get weeded out in basic training, you either conform or you get kicked out for the most part. Trust me, those TIs are good at finding and eliminating the malcontents, although a few do get through. But the foreigners, the gangbangers, the bad element, guys know who they're sharing a foxhole with, or who the guys are in their outfit that they can trust and who they can't. Doesn't matter what their background is, it's not like ordinary natural Americans don't have problems too. So this issue is making a mountainout of a very small molehill.

I served in the Military from 2000-2007, never had to fire on any US Civilians, I still know people serving and they haven't had to either, my point is THIS Military has no experience firing upon crowds of American Civilians.

What you say is true; my problem is with Desperado's assertion that the troops wouldn't think twice about firing on American citizens. Yeah, they would, I hope we never put them in a position to face that situation. I do not appreciate the notion that US soldiers would easily open fire with no qualms about it.

How come the only people here I see using terms like that to refer to our President are Righties?

</quote>

Our way of mocking the way some of his young followers almost deified him in the last campaign. To me, he's an empty suit, a younger, more eloquent version of John Kerry, a Liberal ideologue and political hack who has never held a real job-just an academic and community activist who stands for everything I despise politically, and not very much that I am for politically. We see him like your side saw Bush. Personally I see him as another Ivy League, intellectual snob (I never have yet met one I liked); a permanent civilian, who never served his country (Ivy Leaguers consider themselves too good for that), who never learned the first thing about discipline, leadership or respect, much less courage; and in recent times, a pompous ass as well. In short, I don't like the man, as a president, or as a person; not someone I'd care to share a drink and conversation with, under any circumstances. I don't have any problem figuring out that someone who refers to people like me as "the enemy" is in fact, my enemy. I'll support him beyond the water's edge out of respect for the office; but I will oppose him here at home and do all I can to defeat him in November.

Yup, like I said our Troops currently serving never had to fire upon crowds of their fellow citizens, to say they would just do it and not care is bullshit. Comments like that just show far the divide is now between our civilian sector and our Military/Veterans, civilians really don't know shit about the Military.

First, the only way that martial law would be declared would be a national disaster such as the eruption of Yellowstone, or a nuclear exchange with a major nation. Other than that, it is all in you wingnuts imaginaton.

Second, for there to be a major event where you wound have troops firing on citizens, you would have to have something like one of the fringe lunatic militias occupy a town and shooting citizens.

The miners were opposed by a well-armed contingent of mine guards and State Police with rifles and machine guns. These would eventually be joined by 2,000 U.S. Army troops armed with airplanes, bombs, and poison gas. The two forces met at Blair Mountain, in Logan County. The coal company forces held fortified positions along the ridge; the miners labored in the heat of late summer to climb the mountain with hopes of engaging company forces at the summit.

Waco wasn't a "massacre". What it was..was a travesty. How they let a Christian Terrorist Pedophile, like David Koresh yammer on for several months is beyond me.

And why some conservatives defend that piece of fucking shit..is pathetic.

In general, you don't use the military for civilian peacekeeping because the military trains its soldiers to use lethal force. If faced with resistance, the training kicks in and that's that. I don't blame soldiers for that, it's just how they're trained.

Holding government officials unaccountable for crimes they commit against the American public seems to be a growing trend the last few administrations. Of course, this latest
abberation absolutely takes the cake. The obama administration has taken abuse of the citizens to a high art form, shredding the Constitution and the Rule of Law savagely and continuously.
Personally, I doubt this administration will trust American troops to follow orders to the extent of firing on their own. We've seen information that indicates this administration considers military veterans as potential terrorists. Unless he segregates the troops and garrisons troops of different ethnicity in neighborhoods to be controlled. With the level of racial tension this CinC is fostering and fomenting, that would be one way to get Americans to fire on other Americans. The other possibility is that this administration declares marshal law and invites the UN to send troops.

There's an argument to be made that the Spanish-American War, where we finished taking away all of Spain's toys, was the point where we became a super power.

We weren't a superpower coming out of the Revolutionary War. A lot of the Founders were legitimately concerned we'd collapse quickly. We damn near did in the War of 1812.

Law enforcement was in an impossible situation in Waco, one in which the parents of those children put themselves in. It's analogous to when a police officer finds themselves in a hostage situation where a parent, out of their mind, has a gun on the kids. You know the parent is unstable and could shoot the kids at any time, and you also know that if you act, you risk the kids getting shot. So what's the right choice? Wait and hope reason prevails or act and hope you can move fast enough to save the kids?

I don't think anyone would say that Waco was a perfect example of law enforcement, but considering that it was the cult that precipitated and continued the stand off when they could have stood down at any time, I'm not that sympathetic for the adults involved. Take a shot at a cop or a soldier and don't be surprised when they shoot right back.

The kids though... that is a tragedy. Goddamn wacko parents that put their kids in situations like that.

[With recent reports that Homeland Security has ordered the delivery of 450,000,000 hollow point bullets for its use, more than one bullet for every man woman and child alive today in this country, with Barack Obama, the Office Of White House Communications, mediamatters, and especially MSNBC's Al Sharpton busily trying to orchestrate and foment a Race War bringing about Barack's very own "Reichstag Fire Moment" when he can suspend the Constitution and remove the irritation, chafing and constraints the Bill of Rights places upon him, this is a pertinent question.]

"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizen’s?

The question of troop involvement in a possible upcoming Martial Law scenario that is being predicted is no imaginary possibility – nor is it a ‘conspiracy theory’.

Many readers will recall the survey given to U.S. Marines at the 29 Palms Marine Corps base in California.

The survey asked the respondents to consider the following statement: “I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.”

The current situation is even more alarming, for example:

The passing of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which THEBLAZE covers in an article titled, “Can the ‘Indefinite Detention’ Bill Send Americans to Military Prison Without Trial?” (12-08-11) has caused even the most skeptic to be concerned for their personal safety – especially those fighting for liberty.

The National Defense Resources Preparedness: Comparing Previous Executive Orders article that theintelhub.com posted online is another example of the emergence of a Fascist Police State taking complete control.

Lastly, the purchase by the Department of Homeland Security of 450,000,000 rounds of ammunition over a five year period should be warning enough that something is definitely wrong.

Who are these rounds to be used on? Even at 80,000,000 rounds per year, that’s one bullet for every dissenter at a minimum."

"Will US Troops Fire On US Citizens?"
if ii could make bloody letter too.

First of all, Marines would not be involved in engaging gun nuts screaming "from my cold dead fingers" it is not their mission. ATF agents and local authorities would handle it

As a gun owner, you have a constitutional right to own weapons. You do not have a constitutional right to kill people trying to take your weapon. If authorities come to your door claiming you have an illegal weapon, you are required to turn it over. Your Constitutional rights are to get a lawyer and prove your second amendment rights have been violated

I think it's worth pointing out the larger principle here which is this:

Even if your rights are being violated, once you make a decision to use violence against law enforcement officials, even if they are in the wrong, you likely won't live to make your case in a court of law.

That's just how it is. Once bullets are flying the only folks that care about your Constitutional rights are your heirs who will be profiting from the lawsuit they file with the cops.

That's even more true if you're in a scenario where the US Military is being used to enforce the law. There aren't many folks out there that can say they started a firefight with a Marine because most of the folks stupid enough to do so are now dead. Just because you're a civilian doesn't mean they won't respond with overwhelming force of you start crap.

GOP News Flash: The real reason for soaring gas prices
</headline>
<post author="earthling01" datetime="2012-03-17T12:16:00" id="p1">
There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

2008? isn't that when the Democrats were blaming Booooosh and Cheney and Halliburton for higher gasoline prices? You remember, when the price was $1.87/gallon.

Speculators make bets on whether or not the price of any commodity will go up or down. The price of Gas is based largely on geo political forces and right now the Iranians are threatening to close the Straight of Hormuz effectively cutting back the work's supply of oil by about 1/5.

The mere threat of a shortage has caused the price to rise by about.50/gallon. A real shortage would cause a spike unlike anything ever seen. Of course this is the wet dream of the Big 0's administration.

You know what else? If Americans go to the pumps and there is no gas, they will demand that we get gas and they will not care what has to happen to get it.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

You want the government to put price controls on gas and oil?

</quote>

Did I say that? I have said on this and other boards Presidents can't control gas prices i did not blame Bush for high gas prices and I don't blame Obama for them but the left was more than happy to lay the blame for them on Bush for political gain so I really have no problem with the right doing the same thing to Obama for the same reason.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

</quote>

I didn't need to read any further than this in the Forbes article you linked to know you that intentionally or unintentionally, you are presenting a questionable thesis here:

<quote>
But to suggest that the refinery closures, over these many years, are the result of government regulations—EPA or otherwise—is ridiculous. They closed because the higher prices of oil combined with the lowered demand for oil worked to make these refineries unprofitable for their owners.

</quote>

I didn't think Ungar would be one to suggest oil companies are closing refineries to 'jack up prices' which you posted. And he didn't.

If you read other articles he has written, it is true that EPA regulations are not forcing existing refineries to close (though those same EPA regulations ARE jacking up the price of gasoline), but EPA regulations among other factors are making it highly unattractive for oil companies to attempt to build new refineries in an environment of socioeconomic uncertainties such as are created by the threat of Cap &amp; Trade, continued unrest in the Middle East, etc. etc. etc.

There are so many factors going into the price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, that no single one can be blamed for it all. It is very true that Obama is not to blame for the high price of oil and/or high prices at the pump. But it is also true that the Obama administration has done little or nothing to allieviate the situation and has made it worse by its policy in our own Gulf of Mexico and other coastal waters, nixing the pipeline, and doing nothing to alleviate fears re regulations still overing overhead. A few cents here, a few cents there, eventually adds up to a dollar and a savings of $10.00 to $20.00 or more at the pump. And that factors into everything we buy that is manufactured using petroleum products or transported by machines using petroleum products. Obama gets most of his campaign contributions from Wall Street so he is unlikely to rock the boat in the futures market which could easily be done in the interest of the general welfare to rein in speculators that are hurting us all.

You have to approach it from a macroeconomics perspective, not a single issue perspective.

Ten years ago, the call to open up ANWR and the Bakkan fields, etc. were met with objections that we wouldn't see any difference in supply or at the pump for at least ten years. Well, it is now ten years later. If we had done it then, we would be better off now. But we're still hearing the same arguments. It will take too long to accomplish improvements when we need the relief now, so we won't do the improvements.

If the government ever did get it right so that the oil companies had to go back to work to make a profit and expand, we would see a dramatic improvement in a relatively short time.

Good find., But the fact is, high gas prices are not Obama's fault. It IS his fault that he hasn't done anything practical to move us toward more energy independence and in fact has thrown up some roadblocks toward that goal.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

Like I said, read it again. Read it until you understand it.

The refineries are producing so much gas they can export it at good profit and still meet US demand.

Americans are willing to pay the price on the pump, so why would a gas station lower it?

Especially, why would a seller of gas lower the price to Americans when foreign buyers will pay better?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel with a mandate that the refineries remove the sulfur, a very expensive process.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

Speculators see Obamination constantly preventing more drilling in the US, thus they project higher oil prices in the long term.

You assholes prevent drilling going back decades but then claim drilling now won't affect "today's price." Well, what you did before and what you do now does affect today's price and tomorrow's price because we know you are trying to limit supply to drive everyone into fairy dust cars.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/02/us-exported-more-gasoline-than-imported-last-year/1">U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year</a>

That is the most imcomprehensible part of the Obama energy policy. He won't let U.S. oil companies drill in the gulf and allowed all those off shore rigs go to other countries and we'll have hell to pay to ever get them back. This has cost us millions of barrels of oil and I think thousands of jobs in some of our poorest states that really needed those jobs. And he has further targeted the oil companies, alone among industries, with significantly higher taxes.

But we're subsidzing countries like Columbia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico who are drilling for oil in the Gulf as well as importing oil from them. (And who got those rigs that the Obama administration wouldn't allow here.) And the government didn't say boo to the Russians who recently announced they plan to do some drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

I recommend that everybody listen to that ad one more time before reading this written in May 2010:

<quote>
While the BP oil geyser pumps millions of gallons of petroleum into the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama and members of Congress may have to answer for the millions in campaign contributions they’ve taken from the oil and gas giant over the years.

BP and its employees have given more than $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years, with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donations come from a mix of employees and the company’s political action committees — $2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP-related PACs and about $638,000 came from individuals.

I'd much rather they put a little control on the EPA.

</quote>

Why?

There is so much gasoline being produced in the US that refineries are exporting it, and Americans are WILLING to pay 4 bucks a gallon.

How do YOU fix that?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel for the refineries to remove the diesel.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

</quote>

None of that matters as long as the refineries have overseas buyers willing to pay these prices for gas. What do you think happens to gas prices as more and more Chinese, and Indians, for example, actually get to where they can afford a car?

That's what the bottom line says, doesn't it? That's the year where the x-axis begins, doesn't it? Were you home schooled or something? Is your problem that you're too dumb to have ever seen a financial chart which is adjusted for inflation?

Why?

There is so much gasoline being produced in the US that refineries are exporting it, and Americans are WILLING to pay 4 bucks a gallon.

How do YOU fix that?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel for the refineries to remove the diesel.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

</quote>

None of that matters as long as the refineries have overseas buyers willing to pay these prices for gas. What do you think happens to gas prices as more and more Chinese, and Indians, for example, actually get to where they can afford a car?

</quote>

No. 1 on my list addresses that issues and could take care of it. The other issues are all costs that refineries have to add into the wholesale price of gasoline that the stations have to pass on plus some to cover the taxes and their profit. There is no shortage of domestic fuel supply. So lowering the cost for the manufacturer translates into a lower cost at the pump. A lower cost at the pump then generates more demand as people can afford to travel and drive for pleasure again, and the oil companies would enjoy profits from that too.

In the 1970's, there was supposedly a true gasoline shortage. Stations ran out of fuel and when a station did get a supply, there were long lines and long waits to get your car to the pump while you prayed that the station wouldn't run out of gas or your car wouldn't run out of gas before you got to the pump. That along with high prices for the fuel, high unemployment, double digit inflation, and double digit interest rates was a big reason Jimmy Carter was so thoroughly defeated in his re-election bid.

We are seeing no shortages of fuel anywhere right now. A much different dynamic is in effect.

Here's some very good debunking about the lies the right has been spreading about oil prices.

<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74120.html">Gas price rhetoric pumps up the hype</a>

I loved this tidbit about how the Moonie Times and Weekly Standard tried to distort the story.

<quote>
D.C.-area residents are familiar with the insanely high prices of the Exxon station at the Watergate complex, which routinely charges as much as $1 a gallon more than other stations less than a mile away  including a Sunoco across the street. So that makes it a magnet for news organizations or other groups shopping for a shocking price, especially one within walking distance of the White House.

Hence a blog item last month in The Washington Times, which cited the Exxon under the headline $5 gas hits D.C.

Subsequently, The Weekly Standard featured a photo of the Exxon and its $5.39-a-gallon price, under the possibly satirical headline The Shocking Photo the Obama Administration Doesn't Want You to See. That was followed by a similar item on the Glenn Beck-affiliated website The Blaze and a photo on The National Reviews website.

One dynamic is that economy standards have almost doubled on most average sedans, and quadrupled on hybrids. Our consumption of oil is down significantly from what it was in the '70s, in spite of population growth, and more cars on the road. Add to that the fact that our gas is blended with ethanol. I saw a figure that America now consumes about 5.3 million barrels a day. In the '70s we were over 8 million bbls/day.

The simple issue is that people in India and China, the two most populace countries, aren't traveling by bike as much these days. They're rapidly emerging, with a strong middle class, who want cars. Exxon, Mobil, Shell, BP could double their capacity, but they're going to sell at world prices. They're not in business to help Americans get cheap gas, they'll sell at what the market is willing to pay. Whether it's drilled here or in Saudi Arabia isn't going to change the price.

It won't change the price of a barrel of oil as that is set by the world market. But policy could change the price of a gallon of gasoline if the Administration wanted to help the American people. And they could do that with a policy that would provide the incentive for the oil companies to give the American people a break in return or making their profits on the world market.

The oil industry has not been a free market industry for decades now. It is among the most highly regulated industry in the country and the government does have the power to make a difference. But it has to be done in a way that profits everybody. Try to punish the oil industry without a reasonable offset and despite being under government control, the oil company does not have to play ball. The right and reasonable thing to do is find a win win situation for everybody.

Currently, the economists have all said that the Wall St. speculators have added 50-56 cents per gallon purchased because of their bullshit.

This summer, gas was at 3.20 here in Amarillo, subtract what Wall St. took in, and gas prices would have been around 2.64 to 2.70 if it wasn't for them.

How much has the devaluation of the dollar driven up prices? Got a link, or are you gonna have The "T"ard parrot your bullshit again for ya?

If I remember correctly....the oil companies only make around 10 cents a gallon on profit. There have been numerous congressional investigations to try and nail them for gouging, but for a couple of service stations gouging, they could never come up with anything.

These oil companies are huge...even the small ones like Exxon. Everybody uses gas....this is why they have huge profits. Not from price gouging

It would be helpful if you'd pay attention once in a while, but I understand............that's why you're called The "T"ard.

Maybe you could follow up your '08 treatise by rendering an opinion on why oil prices fell by $100 in a 7 month time span.

Did the "speculator's bullshit" cause the crash in oil prices between June '08 to January '09?

Wax on, wax off.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

</quote>

Hmm. An opinion piece which favors the President's non existent energy policy and of course the expected hall pass.
Where was this when gas prices rose to $4 the first time? Nowhere. Your side blamed the Bush admin claiming both the President and the VP of deliberately sending prices higher to benefit "their rich oil company friends"...
You cannot have it both ways.
The fact is Obama is anti fossil fuels. His energy Secretary has been quoted many times he thinks gas prices here should be what they are in Western Europe.
Obama has dismissed any ideas to allow gas prices to settle. His answer to the people is " Americans must learn to use less gasoline"...
Now, the facts say that despite the liberal talking points listed above, the refining end of the oil business is very expensive here in the US. This is due to the layers of regulations and bureaucratic red tape.
BTW, just because an opinion piece appears in a publication that is perceived to not be biased ot the left, does not mean the piece cannot be of a liberal viewpoint.
The NY Times prints conservative viewpoints on occasion.

Because just like I'd rather hear from a legitimate doctor on medical issues, or would like to hear from a legitimate scientist on science issues, I'd like to hear about oil prices from someone who actually works in the business, instead of some physicist.

Would you trust Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Michio Kaku to tell you why gas prices are what they are? I wouldn't.

Oh yeah..........for uneducated people like you, those are 2 of the top physicists in the world.

With more supply than demand it makes complete logical sense to cut back on production at refineries. It also then makes sense to sell in whatever market there is demand to reduce inventory; hence foreign purchasers.

The price of oil is not set by us oil companies, it's set by the world market based on world supply and commensurate demand and the speculators do not foresee an improvement. Instead they see a supply at risk because the largest player in the marketplace (the US) has no sensible strategy to stabilize the supply nor the demand. It instead touts substitute energy production many decades in the future, if ever, which the speculators view with no confidence.

As a matter of fact the high prices in oil both crude and refined hang on that lack of confidence. Add to that the threats by Iran, a major nation in the region seeking hegemonic supremacy, threatening closure of the shipping bottleneck, combined with a failure over time to deal rationally with that nation and the speculators bid up the price of oil according to the chaos they are seeing.

A new US congress and president taking office together in '13, with a believable policy announcement on US oil pruduction and a naval presence in the Persian Gulf to prevent any temporary closure would begin to settle the markets and wring the speculation out of the equation.

An American president whose best solution to high domestic gasoline prices is to threaten to take away Oil Company "tax breaks," which in reality are allowances for accelerated depreciation which are meant to encourage investment in costly exploration and equipment purchased or manufactured aimed at increasing the oil supply is seen by speculators as being counter-productive to stabilizing oil and gasoline prices.

Oh, and the refining capacity that is being taken off line is the least efficient available, and can't be made more efficient because of permitting requirements by the EPA.

The price of oil expressed in US dollars is not helped by weak dollars because of Fed policy the past three and half years. All commodity prices show that weakness.

Gasoline prices have dropped in California in the past few days for one simple and what should be a instructive reason; the switching from winter blend to summer blend - which will lower the price until elevated summer driving demand pushes it back up. This is being touted as a panacea.

All across America gasohol blends are mandated that actually lower automobile gas mileage, cost more than unblended gasoline because ethanol is much more costly to produce, is federally subsidized, burns dirtier, as well as adds direct costs for the blending process itself.

We have a system in chaos, with no logical controlling authority. This undermines confidence in positive expectations, exacerbates doubt, hence speculation that the situation can get worse before it gets better.

The American people understand WHO AND WHY the price of gas and oil are spiking.

Even the trolls on this board pretending they don't get it and trying to pin that blame on Obama, really understand it.

So debating this issue with those lying trolls is a basically a pointless exercise unless you're fond of watching people make partisan asses of themselves.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

Speculators due exactly that speculate and they take everything into consideration in order to make money so all the policies and uncertainty in the economy lead them to buy and sell - raise lower the price of oil ect so how can it not be placed on the current administration? After all its his policies and some other from before him.
Im sure if cap and trade were in place it would be alot higher...
Its called supply and demand so if we didnt need as much due to the fact that we have our own they would speculate down!

No one's willing to recognize the Federal Reserve's role in this? After the collapse in 2008 oil fell hard to $30/bbl. The Fed instituted several massive liquidity injections to buy junk MBS and reflate the economy, and then proceeded to utilize 2 separate rounds of quantitative easing. This inflated the monetary base to historic proportions and severely devalued the Dollar.

Ever since that, oil has continued to climb.

It's the DOLLAR.

To sum up the stupdity and lies by liberals on this subject...

When Bush was President and the price of gas rose, Democrats like Kerry went on TV saying Bush was allowing the Saudis to limit the world supply of oil to increse their profits. Meanwhile Bush with no power over the Saudis increased domestic drilling in the USA....but was still blamed for fairy dust stories regarding middle east oil.

When Obamination got into office, his EPA and Dept of the Interior goons slowed and even stopped drilling permits on Federal lands, even defying a Federal judge based in Louisiana to reopen drilling in the Gulf. His Dept of Energy idiot leader (white roads Chu) said he wanted $10/gallon gas in the USA, but then tried to cover it up at Congress hearings last week.

Of course, speculators that buy and sell future crud options see Obamination and his fellow goons driving up the price of oil with their policies, so they bet on rising oil prices.....

Oh, but this is alllllllllll Bush's fault.

You admit Canada adds more in taxes to their gas at the pump.....which drives up the cost, but then you wonder why their gas is higher than our gas price.

Canadian politicians and higher shipping costs add cents to dollars on their gas, so it costs more to get gas in Canada.

Obamination is helping drive up the cost of gas here by preventing drilling on Federal lands. The people that buy and sell future oil sales see Obamination limiting SUPPLY, so the price goes up.

Obamination is guilty of higher gas prices here just like the Canadian and English left-wing politicians are in their countries.

No actually we didn't. As one of the "silly libs" you are talking about, I always blamed the oil companies and speculators for the price of gas. If you look at polls from that time, most people DID NOT blame Bush.

Granted, more people blamed Bush than they blame Obama now, (but not by a large margin 25% to 18%) but that might have something to do with the fact that Bush was an oil man that started an unnecessary war in oil country...and was photographed kissing Saudi Oil princes.

Too stupid to know how to click on the link I provided? What a moron.

</quote>

I wasn't too stupid to click on the link and read the honest assessment that the big spike in gasoline prices in the Bush administration was due to Katrina and most of the Gulf rigs being closed down for inspection and/or repairs. By the end of the Bush administration, after those rigs came back on line, gas prices had returned to tolerable levels.

What the blogger didn't say however is that President Bush had a hostile media who buried the real reasons for negative indicators and left the public with the impression that it was the President's fault. They would put some Democrat's criticism of the President near the top of the story for instance, and tack on a headline that "The Bush Administration Comes Under Increasing Criticism" or some such as that.

The media can and does absolutely influence public perception in all who don't read much below the headlines or who do get most of their news from leftwing blogs or 30 second soundbites. And as more and more of America is dumbed down in an inferior education system, the more power the media has.

They don't do that to Obama. The mostly Obama friendly media points to every possible indicator OTHER than President Obama's policies for the reason for high gas prices. At least in the first paragraphs in the newspaper or in the lead in on the evening television news. Headlines are more likely to reflect a President who is concerned rather than policies that are at least partially to blame.

The blogger also said that even though the perception is that it isn't Obama's fault now, it couldl be a problem for him if gas prices remain high at the time of the 2012 election.

So why is that? It's simple really. Gas goes on the WORLD MARKET where oil companies and speculators control what the price will be.

Got to love all the silly liberals, they still claim that high gas prices were Bush's fault, yet today's high gas prices are not Obama's fault.

It doesn't matter whose fault it is, if they are high in November and the economy starts to fall again because of the high fuel costs, Obama will take a big hit with the voters.

</quote>

No actually we didn't. As one of the "silly libs" you are talking about, I always blamed the oil companies and speculators for the price of gas. If you look at polls from that time, most people DID NOT blame Bush.

Granted, more people blamed Bush than they blame Obama now, (but not by a large margin 25% to 18%) but that might have something to do with the fact that Bush was an oil man that started an unnecessary war in oil country...and was photographed kissing Saudi Oil princes.

Rather have something other than an opinion piece. Real facts that can be verified if ya got 'em, because otherwise, I'd have to take this person's word (who doesn't really appear to be in the oil business).

I came up with this one, ABS:
Update: ExxonMobil is now reporting that for its retail gasoline operations in the U.S., it made an average profit of 7 cents per gallon during the first quarter of 2011.
<a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2011/05/carpe-diem-gasoline-taxes-per-gallon-are-almost-7-times-exxonmobils-profit-42-cents-vs-7-cents-for-qi.html">Environmental Economics: Gas taxes and profit per gallon are noncomparable</a>

My father was in the oil business for 30 years, ABS. I used to hammer on him about the profits and he showed me that they made around 10 cents a gallon profit. That was 30 years ago.

Like I said earlier, they have had congressional hearings on this and always walked away with nothing on the oil companies

</quote>

Quick question...................if the oil companies are only making 9 cents per gal, then why the fuck does Wall St. get 50 to 56 cents per gal?

</quote>

First..Stop the "wall street" buzz word nonsense.
To answer you question. Traders are "getting" 50 cents per gallon. I have no idea what that means anyway. Probably some interpretation by biased members of the media.
The story goes that commodities trading accounts for roughly 50 cents per gallon of gasoline. I would imagine this means at the retail level. Where this alleged data originated is a mystery.
Actually retailers make more like 2-3 cents per gallon on regular. Of course the margins for mid grade and premium are higher. Retailers sell much less of these two products.
Now, the reason margins are so low for regular....Most gas is sold at convenience stores. One store owner who I got to know very well showed me his invoices during a conversation we were having about gas prices. His retail price was just 2 cents above his cost. Why? In his words he said the only reason he sold gas was to get people to come into the store to purchase items. His markups for merchandise were 50 to 100%.
If one really wants to find a culprit for high gas prices they can look right to government.
For example. Here in NC we pay a whopping 39.5 cents per gallon fuel tax, then sales tax then the 18 cents per gallon federal tax.
Roughly 70 cents per gallon goes to government in the form of tax.
I am not implying gasoline should not be taxed. However, when the gas tax is supposed to go to roads new and existing, it gets mighty frustrating when the politicians tell us there is a shortage of money for road projects BTW 39.5 cents per gallon is one the highest gas taxes in the US.

If oil traders and various other financial institutions are bullish on the price of gas they will buy up gas futures contracts; the demand for the contracts pushes up their prices.

Yes, their demand for contracts pushes up the value of the contracts.
So how does that push up the price of gas?
The financial institution doesn't take delivery of the gas.
They don't consume the gas.

There are lots of ways different events can cause commodity prices to swing one way or another. Speculators just react to those events.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

That's a red herring. We don't import gasoline, but of course we do export it so it goes without saying that we'd export more than we import (zero). It's a comparison that goes without saying, and is made for the confusion it sows.

Furthermore it's a world market, and we sell to it. The only way that could be precluded would be to nationalize the oil companies.

There is oil in S. Texas (the Gulf) that cannot be piped east because of a pipeline bottleneck, and the price is lower than the world market because of the glut there. It makes perfect sense that they would refine it and sell it at a premium, and part of that refined product would be exported, since they can't sell it profitably (glut) in their own region.

It's not driving up the price of gasoline elsewhere, and it is applies favorably to lower the US trade deficit.

Not quite. Anyone who can pass some silly litmus literacy test for the commodity exchange (in any case, anyone), can also buy and sell the actual future of a product, with a promise to accept shipment or deliver. They can also sell that contract on the open market. As it stands today, only 1/3 of the actual futures contracts on oil, are between people who can actually deliver or accept a commodity. The other 2/3rds are just gambling.

The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

The commodity futures contract still represents physical oil. That oil is still delivered from the supplier to the consumer. If investment banks took delivery &amp; resold/rolled over that oil it would increase the amount of supply driving down the price. The physical oil has to be stored somewhere (preferably hidden from inventory) in order to drive up prices. Last time they keep the oil on a bunch of tankers out in the ocean where it did not show up in inventory.

WHERE ARE THE OIL THE SPECULATORS HOLDING ALL THAT OIL???? Inquiring minds would like to know.

Without letting the manipulators off the hook, they are able to do what they are doing only because the supply/demand ratio of oil has gotten worse. Otherwise, there would be no room for it.

This is not unlike the OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s, whose immediate cause was political manipulation by an oil cartel many of whose members were pissed off by the Yom Kippur War. But OPEC would not have been able to pull that off except that the U.S. hit its national oil peak in 1970 and, after that, became dependent on oil imports.

I'm not saying that speculation and profiteering aren't factors making the situation worse, but the geological and global-economic reality is that the era of cheap oil is over, and it's never coming back.

Exxon-Mobil's CEO, Rex Tillerson only knows what his cost of supply is. Exxon-Mobil only makes up a small slice of the oil market. Why is he not supplying all the oil the market needs to make enormous profits at $126 Brent Crude World Price? - Someone is limiting his supply capacity.

Speculators can't drive up oil prices unless they have the means to store the oil outside of the commodities market. Inventories are below expectations &amp; the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index is low which means speculators are not renting oil tankers to store oil off-shore. There is a supply problem brought on by government!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

</quote>

Not so; although in a commodity futures contract the purchaser promises to take possession at some fixed future date, the purchaser may instead sell that contract and never take actual possession. Speculators purchasing options do not promise to take physical possession of the commodity, in this case oil. They may choose to or they may simply sell the option and reap the profit or the loss making that decision at the options exercise date, and the demand they create in the market can and does drive up prices.

</quote>

The commodity futures contract still represents physical oil. That oil is still delivered from the supplier to the consumer. If investment banks took delivery &amp; resold/rolled over that oil it would increase the amount of supply driving down the price. The physical oil has to be stored somewhere (preferably hidden from inventory) in order to drive up prices. Last time they keep the oil on a bunch of tankers out in the ocean where it did not show up in inventory.

WHERE ARE THE OIL THE SPECULATORS HOLDING ALL THAT OIL???? Inquiring minds would like to know.

</quote>

Interesting observation. During the so called "Arab oil embargo" vs the US, the news media shot film of tankers parked off the NJ/NY coast waiting to be unloaded. Until then, we Americans were told there was a severe shortage. The scam was that while we were told ot conserve gasoline, that brought into play the term "allocation". So as we did our civic duty and slashed our consumption of fuel, the so called allocation was reduced in proportion to fuel used. WTF?!!!! Use less, receive less. Nice going. As a result, we were introduced ot the term 'stagflation'....The eocnomy was at a standstill while consumer prices continued to rise.
As I recall, soon after the parked tanker scam was uncovered, the 'embargo' was lifted. Gas prices tumbled.

WHAT?!!!!!
Taxing supply only causes prices to increase as those taxes are passed along to the end user.
BTW Commodities trades ARE taxed..... <a href="http://commodities.about.com/od/taxissues/a/commodity_taxes.htm">Taxes on Commodities Trading</a>.
Tillereson told Cantwell exactly what she needed to hear. The end game is 'blame someone else'.
Newsflash...If there were no market to trade commodities, the prices for them would have to fixed by a group or entity placed in charge of this.
Are you sure you desire to see price fixing beome the procedure?

Let's see.

Conservatives supported the Contras, which engaged in large numbers of human rights violations, including outright murder through what became known as death squads.

Then there was the conservative support to the racist Apartheid regime of South Africa.

And who can forget the Heritage Foundation's and Grover Norquist's support for Joseph Savimbi and UNITA in Angola?

Citing one poster on USMB as the end all in conservative/libertarian views has got to be the biggest reach I've seen in a while.

Libertarians are about as close to classical liberalism as it gets today. the left wing "progressive" liberals are nothing short of full blown communist totalitarians. Like Obama.

And there are no true conservatives left on the right except the social conservative kind. Which is not what conservatism is about.

Are you normally this incredibly stupid, or is this just a moment you're having?

Citing one poster on USMB as the end all in conservative/libertarian views has got to be the biggest reach I've seen in a while.

Libertarians are about as close to classical liberalism as it gets today. the left wing "progressive" liberals are nothing short of full blown communist totalitarians. Like Obama.

And there are no true conservatives left on the right except the social conservative kind. Which is not what conservatism is about.

No, they argue that there SHOULDN'T BE LAWS PROHIBITING THE USE OF DRUGS.. As in there are already laws on the books that have been legislated by tyrants....

Drugs were legal until Woodrow Wilson (a fucking tyrant) thought HE WAS A DICTATOR and started outlawing shit...

You see how that works dummy???

As it is the government is regulating what substances people can and cannot use and that goes against libertarian beliefs -- you know -- because libertarians are REAL LIBERALS unlike authoritarian progressives who believe the government SHOULD CONTROL WHAT SUBSTANCES AN INDIVIDUAL CAN INGEST....

So once again its the authoritarian tyrants (neocons, RINO's and progressives) who are the tyrants....

There shouldn't be a law in the first place.

It was the authoritarian tyrannical government that manifested the law in the first place..

Libertarians aren't advocating for the legalization of drugs, they're advocating for the repeal of present laws that outlaw drugs.

Reason: The government has no right telling individuals what they can do to their own body...

Do American Conservatives and Libertarians adore dictatorships, totalitarianism?

</quote>

Lets say their dogma is predicated on authoritarianism  conservatives have an intense need to compel others to conform, they detest diversity and dissent, and as reactionaries long for an idealized American past that never really existed in the first place.

They dont intentionally adore dictatorships, but share many similar traits, however inadvertent.

To wit:

Polarization also has affected the two parties differently. The Republican Party has drifted much farther to the right than the Democratic Party has drifted to the left. Jacob Hacker, a professor at Yale, whose 2006 book, Off Center, documented this trend, told me, citing Poole and Rosenthals data on congressional voting records, that, since 1975, Senate Republicans moved roughly twice as far to the right as Senate Democrats moved to the left and House Republicans moved roughly six times as far to the right as House Democrats moved to the left. In other words, the story of the past few decades is asymmetric polarization.

Two well-known Washington political analysts, Thomas Mann, of the bipartisan Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agree.

In a forthcoming book about Washington dysfunction, Its Even Worse Than It Looks, they write, One of our two major parties, the Republicans, has become an insurgent outlierideologically extreme, contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime, scornful of compromise, unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.

The deal is, you don't make the ideal the enemy of the good. If you have to choose between the very bad and the horrible, you go for the lesser evil.

That does not mean the lesser evil is the goal and you support it contrary to all sense. Though one can argue we have done that mistake.

One of the failures of US Foreign policy has been to assume that we are stuck with Hobson's choice. That is not always the case. We may just need to recognize there are more options.

Liberals like to treat each case as if it had no relation to what is going on around it. You either support or oppose this moderately bad with no recognition of what the alternatives are or what the surrounding circumstances are.

There is more to Foreign affairs than just one question in one place. A lot of times when you flip one counter, lots of other counters around it also flip in ways that can cause greater problems than leaving well enough alone

You offer that quote as though them saying such tripe somehow makes it "right."

The fact of the matter is, they are full of shit.

The Republican Party isn't the engine of change. The Republican Party is part of the problem.

The engine of change lies in the awakening many of us are having over how badly off-course we are.

I keep reading the propaganda of the day which seeks to "define" who and what conservatives are. But it's malarkey.

Conservatives don't seek the status quo. Why would we wish to keep things the "way they are" when the way things are are so fucked up, due to incremental liberal changes, that we have ended up in a very bad place?

Conservatives, properly understood, seek to put things BACK to the way they are SUPPOSED TO BE.

Pontificators can label that effort "ideologically extreme, contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime, scornful of compromise, unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition." In fact, that's got some truth in it.

If looking to correct our course is considered ideologically extreme, then count me in. If it constitutes being "contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime," then yeah, that's me. I AM contemptuous of the notion that because this is where we've landed, we are obligated to STAY HERE. That's ridiculous. HERE is not a good place. We are in danger of crumbling. We DO in fact need to move. I AM contemptuous of the silly modern American liberalism that takes us here and seeks to move us even further away from where we should be. I DO scorn "compromise" which serves only to solidify the invalid "gains" of the left over these many recent years. You bet your ASS that I am "unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science [sic]," when those "fats" aren't real facts, the evidence has gotten deliberately distorted and the science is fiction. And no. The political opposition is not "legitimate" exactly to the extent that they rebuff the strictures of the Constitutionally imposed limits on government authority and power.

Words like progressive, liberal, conservative, libertarian authoritarian, and totalitarian are too difficult for many to rationalize.

and whom did Reagan trade arms to in violation of American law?

November 13, 1986 -- in his first public statement about the allegations of secret arms-for-hostages negotiations with Iran

"In spite of the wildly speculative and false stories of arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not -- repeat did not -- trade weapons or anything else for hostages nor will we."

March 3, 1987 -- from a televised address in which he admitted to the findings of the Tower Commission

"A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and evidence tell me it is not."

huh?

Sarah Palin: "McCains Campaign Managers Wouldn't Let Us Investigate Obama's Past."
</headline>
<post author="Mudslinger" datetime="2012-03-12T16:00:00" id="p1">
The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

What do you expect from a man that is all too readily willing to reach across the aisle to the left to set up Conservatives for a good drubbing from them?

And he repeats the same shit...and is called a "Maverick" by the leftist media. (There a clue here)...and then goes back to Arizona for re-election parading around saying he's 'Conservative'...gets re-elected, and goes back to old habits.

I admire his military service and what he endured...him as a politician...is where it ends. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

And you would be correct my friend. I actually worked on the campaign. We started receiving texts or emails not to say anything negative regarding to his possible religion or even mention his middle name or church. We were not allowed to do any of that in the districts I was in. I think the media was reporting 80% negative stories on McCain compared to about 25% negative stories on Obama. It was lopsided in the positive media coverage when it came to favor-ability for Obama. Anything deemed negative a campaign staffer allegedly would say, the media would label the whole campaign racist. Even McCain was so sensitive he even apologized for radio host Billy Cunnigham for mentioning Obama's middle name at a McCain rally prior to McCain taking the stage. You're right, McCain didn't want Palin to upstage him and her campaign stops received 30% more people than he.

The lesson to be learned here is that wallowing in self pity is not a good thing. We lost the election. Move on. Everytime the left brings up Bush or Palin were all over them. What's good for the goose.......

Besides we have enough rdean radical types already.

<post author="Mudslinger" datetime="2012-03-12T17:02:00" id="p27">
All of this information about Obama's radical connections have been known since 2008. These facts have been hiding in plain sight all along.The media has failed to report it, and the media has failed or more accurately refused to demand proof of Obama's identity and eligibility. It still refuses to do so. Sheriff Joe Arpaio's investigation has proven his birth certificate to be a forgery along with his selective service card. That's just the preliminary findings. The media should be abolished for their failure to report this. As the Sheriff said this morning in a interview, "This is 10 times bigger than Watergate".

they dealt with that issue in the flim.

what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.

but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.

and it's not like the tweeting twit who said there are "pro america parts of the country" would have looked any smarter if she brought McCain into the slime and mud.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

I think Dole's campaign was sabotaged in the same way.

During the 96' campaign Bob Dole was advised not to be funny, be serious. Bob Dole was a funny motherfucker, but his campaign advised him to stay serious.

After Dole lost the election he a Clinton went around the country and even showed up in Somalia. Dole busted everyone up. Clinton was 2 hours late. By the time he arrived everyone was pissed.

what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.

they dealt with that issue in the flim.

what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.

but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.

and it's not like the tweeting twit who said there are "pro america parts of the country" would have looked any smarter if she brought McCain into the slime and mud.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat.

No one could investigate Obama's past without being called a RACIST--and I am certain that was what it was all about.

Still today--NO ONE can criticize Obama's policies without being called a racist. You gripe about gas prices--you're a racist--you bring up Obama's economy--you're a racist--you bring up run away government spending--you're a racist, etc. etc. etc.

Here's the reason as stated by the VP of the Confederacy:

"But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other-though last, not least: the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. "

No, it makes him a British Subject and not eligible for the presidency or Article 2 Section 1. Read the last sentence from a paragraph from his campaign website Fight the Smears.

"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom’s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.‘s children.

Sad really, have a good day.

Really?

You know what's sad?

Todd Palin is Native American in the right-winger's eyes, because he's 1/8th Yup'ik, yet President Obama's 1/2 African blood doesn't make him black.

Priceless.

So? What others think isnt important in that situation. The tribe has the final say.

Try to be relevant.

Oh my good Lord, you really don't.

When that cunt Bernie wife of Billy Ayers said "stick a fork in her" she was referring to Sharon Tate.

9 months pregnant Sharon Tate The bitches not only killed Polanski's wife they stabbed the baby to death in her body.

That's who Bernie was referring to. Bernie was thrilled to death that Tate was not only killed but that the evil bastards stabbed her repeatedly in her abdomen.

That's Bill Ayer's wife. Want me to go on?

Go on.

P.S. Is saying that a crime?

Are you thrilled Bernie said it?
