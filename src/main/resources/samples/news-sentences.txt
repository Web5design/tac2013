AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	1	167	350	Chilean health authorities confirmed 26 new cases of swine flu on Sunday, raising the number of patients with A(H1N1) virus in the country to 276, the highest number on the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	2	360	528	The sometimes-deadly disease continued its rise across Latin America meanwhile with Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Dominican Republic all reporting new cases. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	3	538	660	Officials here said that most of the victims were in the capital, and that most cases were mild and being treated at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	4	661	723	Three people remain in serious condition in hospital, however. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	5	733	909	Swine flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North America in late April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	6	919	1048	According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually now killed more than 110 people around the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	7	1058	1196	In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold, as winter sets in and the regular flu season gets underway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	8	1206	1363	Argentine health authorities meanwhile reported 15 new cases on Sunday, a day after reporting 20 new cases, raising the country's total patient count to 115. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	9	1373	1597	Officials in Buenos Aires said those with new swine flu infections were recovering well and that most of them were found at several private schools in the capital, where students had recently returned from the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	10	1607	1708	The outbreak has prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid to contain the virus. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	11	1718	1958	In the Dominican Republic officials confirmed nine cases of the disease, raising the country's total to 11, a day after Santo Domingo rebuffed a Russian claim that the Caribbean island was underreporting its cases in a bid to boost tourism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	12	1968	2169	"We fear that in reality, the situation is very different," Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's chief sanitary inspector, had told the Interfax news agency in response to the island reporting only two cases. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	13	2179	2290	On Sunday the island's Ministry of Public Health reported that of the nine new cases one had been hospitalized. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	14	2300	2415	In Peru health authorities said they had confirmed two more cases of the virus, bringing the country's total to 40. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	15	2425	2517	Both cases were found in Lima and are recovering well on medication at home, officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	16	2527	2612	Brazil also confirmed four new cases, which brought the country's total number to 20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	17	2622	2758	At its last count at the end of last week Mexican authorities said 97 people had died from the disease and that 4,932 had been infected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	18	2759	2828	Officials however maintained that the epidemic was on the wane there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	0	58	125	Basketball: Despite sting of defeat, James says Cavs on right track 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	1	208	384	National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player LeBron James insisted Sunday that Cleveland were on the right track, despite their painful failure to reach the NBA finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	2	394	633	James couldn't bring himself to address the media or congratulate the players of the Orlando Magic on Saturday night, after the Magic defeated the Cavs in game six of the Eastern Conference finals to reach the league's championship series. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	3	643	791	But as he and teammates gathered for the last team meeting of the season here on Sunday, James tried to put a positive spin on the Cavaliers season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	4	801	972	Cleveland notched the best record in the regular season with 66 victories, won their division and swept to victory in four games in each of their first two playoff series. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	5	982	1139	Then they ran into the surprising Magic, who had already ousted reigning champions Boston in seven games, and even "King" James's heroics couldn't save them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	6	1149	1284	"You want to continue to get better, that's all you can ask," said James, whose team lost to Boston in the conference finals last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	7	1294	1369	"We got better this season and I feel this team will be better next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	8	1370	1409	You don't want to take a step backward. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	9	1410	1529	I thought we went forward from the Boston series to this year and hopefully we can go forward one more time next year." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	10	1539	1606	James certainly did all he could to take his team one step further. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	11	1616	1689	His buzzer-beating 3-pointer saved Cleveland in game two against Orlando. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	12	1690	1818	He had 21 points, 17 in the second half, in game five, a contest that saw him finish with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	13	1828	1984	Now the big question exercising Cleveland - the club's management, his teammates and Cavs fans - is how this defeat will influence his future with the team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	14	1994	2051	The Cavaliers can offer him a contract extension in July. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	15	2052	2190	He can extend the contract up to four years, or play out his current contract that ends after next season and make a move via free agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	16	2191	2253	He could also exercise a player option for the 2010-11 season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	17	2263	2313	"I haven't thought about it just yet," James said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	18	2314	2440	"I'm just going to take time off from basketball and not think about contracts or the game, period, and relax with my family." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	19	2450	2613	James defended his actions in Orlando on Saturday, when he strode off the court - to a smattering of taunts from Magic fans - without congratulating his opponents. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	20	2623	2727	"I just didn't have much to say," said James, who said he had since e-mailed Orlando star Dwight Howard. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	21	2728	2843	"One thing about me you've got to understand - it is hard for me to congratulate somebody after just losing to him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	22	2853	2867	"I'm a winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	23	2868	2920	That's not being a poor sport or anything like that. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	24	2921	3007	If somebody beats you up, you are not going to congratulate them (for) beating you up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	25	3008	3039	That doesn't make sense to me."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	1	192	361	The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	2	371	583	Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession ahead of European and local elections later this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	3	593	775	"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is palpable," Lambert told the FT. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	4	785	881	"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by these disclosures." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	5	891	1135	He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to one side." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	6	1145	1373	Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	7	1383	1589	The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip) and the far-right British National Party to benefit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	8	1599	1785	Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing with the economy every day." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	9	1795	2013	In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP, describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	1	210	385	Steve Stricker birdied the second playoff hole to win the 6.2 million-dollar Colonial on Sunday, leaving South African Tim Clark still in search of his first USPGA tour title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	2	395	582	Stricker defeated Clark and Steve Marino in the playoff to claim his first title of 2009 to go with his runner-up, third-place, fourth-place, sixth- and seventh- place finishes this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	3	592	631	For Clark it was yet another near miss. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	4	632	737	His 12.7 million dollars in US earnings are the most of any player without a victory in PGA Tour history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	5	747	858	He squandered a two-shot lead with five holes left, including a bogey on the 72nd hole that forced the playoff. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	6	868	954	He also missed a putt that would have given him the victory at the first playoff hole. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	7	964	1056	On the second, Stricker stuck his approach within a few feet and Clark almost followed suit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	8	1066	1126	But Clark's hit the stick and rolled more than 20 feet away. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	9	1127	1218	The South African missed his birdie attempt and Stricker made his for a fifth career crown.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	1	189	387	Britain's Prince Harry admitted Monday that he sometimes questions whether he will succeed in his army training -- but said his brother Prince William helps take the pressure off by cooking for him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	2	397	538	The 24-year-old, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late princess Diana, is currently training to be a pilot with the Army Air Corps.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	5	740	829	And now we are living together and it's fantastic," Harry said in a syndicated interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	6	839	875	"(William) does most of the cooking. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	7	876	1009	I spend time just lying around, watching TV and doing my work," he said, and joked: "The RAF don't have to work as hard as the army." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	8	1019	1185	William is reportedly giving his brother advice ahead of his first helicopter flight in the coming weeks, and Harry admitted that he had found the training difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	9	1195	1269	"The flying courses are so intense," he said, adding: "It's surprised me." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	10	1279	1371	He said: "There's times when I thought, you know, I'm really not cut out for this, mentally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	11	1372	1428	I hope I've got the physical skills to fly a helicopter.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	1	194	397	New therapies developed following groundbreaking clinical trials appear to effectively target breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to research unveiled Sunday at a major cancer conference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	2	407	576	The first therapy targeting the capacity of cancer cells to repair themselves shows promise in treating breast cancer, according to results of two small clinical trials. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	3	586	817	The new agent, especially adept at targeting cancers that are most difficult to cure, neutralizes an enzyme called PARP (poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase) and prevents it from playing its usual role in repairing the DNA of damaged cells. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	4	827	957	Like healthy cells, cancerous cells employ PARP to regenerate themselves after they have been damaged by chemo-therapy treatments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	5	967	1092	The studies examined whether breast cancers are more susceptible to chemotherapy when the PARP enzymes have been neutralized. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	6	1102	1211	The first clinical trial was conducted with 116 women suffering from so-called triple negative breast cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	7	1221	1340	These involve fast-spreading tumors that account for 15 percent of the 170,000 annual cases worldwide of breast cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	8	1350	1529	Some of the cases were treated with chemotherapy and a PARP inhibitor called BSI-201 made by the firm BiPar Sciences, a US affiliate of the French-owned laboratory Sanofi-Aventis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	9	1539	1596	The rest of the group was treated only with chemotherapy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	10	1606	1872	After six months, about 62 percent of the patients treated with BSI-201 combined with chemotherapy showed a comparative clinical improvement of 21 percent over the control group, said Joyce O'Shaughnessy, of the Baylor-Charles Sammons cancer center in Dallas, Texas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	11	1882	2015	She presented the results of the study at a conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology this weekend in Orlando, Florida. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	12	2025	2291	The women treated with BSI-201 survived 9.2 months on average, including 6.9 months in which the cancer did not spread, compared to an average survival of 6.9 months and 3.3 months in which the cancer was in check for those who were treated solely with chemotherapy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	13	2301	2426	The second clinical study involved 54 women suffering from advanced breast cancer linked to the gene mutation BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	14	2427	2529	They were treated with the PARP blocker Olaparib made by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical AstraZenica. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	15	2530	2557	There was no control group. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	16	2567	2739	The test showed that 40 percent of the patients who took the drug experienced a reduction in their tumors, said Andrew Tutt, a cancer specialist at Kings College in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	17	2749	2941	In another study presented here researchers examined a vaccine on patients over eight years that targeted follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a particularly aggressive form of lymphatic cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	18	2951	3189	The study found that patients who received the BiovaxID vaccine experienced on average disease-free survival of approximately 44 months, compared to about 30 months for patients who received a control vaccine -- an increase of 47 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	19	3199	3351	The BiovaxID vaccine is patient-specific, in that each dose must be individually manufactured from tissue obtained from a patient's own cancerous tumor. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	20	3361	3595	"With this vaccine, we've now moved into an era where we can safely use a patient's immune system to effectively fight follicular lymphoma and enhance the response to conventional chemotherapy" said lead study author Stephen Schuster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	21	3605	3805	"Because this vaccine uniquely recruits the patient's immune system to seek and destroy only tumor B-cells, this approach may be applicable to the treatment of other B-cell lymphomas," Schuster added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	3	376	571	"It is with shock and sadness that the government and people of Guinea-Bissau have learnt of the loss of one of their most illustrious sons, Luis Cabral," the government announced in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	4	581	719	The government was to hold an emergency session to organise preparations for a three-day period of national mourning, the statement added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	5	729	897	Natural Resources Minister Oscar Barbosa, a close ally of the former president, said that Cabral had died of a heart attack in the Portuguese capital on Saturday night. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	6	907	1145	Cabral was a half-brother of Amilcar Cabral, long-time leader of the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) liberation movement, who was assassinated in 1973 -- the year before Guinea-Bissau attained its independence from Portugal.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	1	194	393	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party before crunch European and local elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	2	403	603	He said the expenses furore, which has shown how lawmakers claimed from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island, was "appalling" and "offends everything that I believe in". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	3	613	728	Every member of parliament would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last four years, he promised. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	4	738	920	Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said they will resign since the Daily Telegraph newspaper began publishing the leaked claims three weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	5	930	1077	A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested the revelations would hit Brown hard at the European and local elections, in which Britons vote Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	6	1087	1271	It suggested Labour would come third in the elections for the European Parliament with just 17 percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and the smaller centrist Liberal Democrats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	7	1281	1466	Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in an opinion poll since 1987.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	10	1788	1857	"Things go up and down," he said in an interview with BBC television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	11	1858	1943	"We're going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	12	1953	2175	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	14	2429	2559	Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	15	2569	2802	Public anger over expenses is widespread and in a sermon Sunday, the leader of the Scottish Catholic church expressed concern at the "fall from grace" of many people in politics, saying "money (was) at the root of many difficulties". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	16	2812	2961	Cardinal Keith O'Brien called on "those in public service of whatever kind who have failed us to reclaim the high standards which we expect of them". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	17	2971	3116	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low, due partly to widespread Eurosceptic sentiment, and in 2004 turnout was just 38 percent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	0	58	114	Golf: Frenchman Cevaer shocks field to win European Open 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	1	188	313	France's Christian Cevaer, ranked a lowly 449th in the world, shocked a strong field to win the European Open here on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	2	323	610	After four rounds of golf that saw 45 changes of the lead, the 39-year-old Frenchman, who has failed to make the top-30 in his last 15 starts and whose only previous Tour victory was the 2004 Spanish Open, beat England's Steve Webster, Scot Gary Orr and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros by a shot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	3	620	809	His winning total of 281, seven under par, was 13 strokes more than Ross Fisher took on the same London Club course last year - and his 74 was the highest last round by a winner all season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	4	819	1047	But while Webster and Quiros both became more victims of the 471-yard last when tied for the lead - both carved their drives into the crowd, with Quiros hitting spectators with his first and second shots - Cevaer kept his nerve. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	5	1057	1281	During the week the par four played to an average of nearly 4.7, with 154 bogeys, 48 doubles and 26 sevens or worse, but Cevaer parred it the first two days, birdied it in the third round and finished with the par he needed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	6	1291	1376	"I'm not a long player, but I used my utility club and it worked out great," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	7	1386	1486	"I made a point that no matter what happened just enjoy my golf, enjoy my skills and hang in there." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	8	1496	1647	He played the front nine in 39 and did not have a birdie until the long 15th, but the problems meant that it brought him back into a share of top spot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	9	1657	1801	And then three closing pars were good enough to give him the 300,000 pounds first prize - easily the biggest of his 16-year professional career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	10	1811	1984	At 196th on the "Race to Dubai" money list entering the week he would have been delighted just to secure his card for next season, but now he has a five-year Tour exemption.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	12	2012	2201	Overnight leader Jeev Milkha Singh of India was still at the top of the leaderboard in the European Open after windy conditions took a toll of scores at the London Club in Kent on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	13	2211	2342	Singh shot a one under par 71 to leave him in the joint lead with France's Christian Cevaer who went one better with a round of 70. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	14	2352	2578	But hot on their heels was 20-year-old rising star Rory McIlroy who caught the eye with a four-under-par 68 that saw the Northern Irishman close to within three shots of the leading duo after he'd been in 25th place overnight. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	15	2588	2679	Alongside McIlroy in joint third place were England's Chris Wood and Spain's Alvaro Quiros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	16	2689	2895	Singh, the world number 39, defied the conditions to cover the final six holes in a superb four under par on a day where Spain's Sergio Garcia was one of several players to finish with a triple bogey seven. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	17	2905	3012	Before his round Singh said it was vital for the progress of golf in India that it became an Olympic sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	18	3022	3125	"Golf not being an Olympic sport we have not been getting any funding from the government," Singh said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	19	3135	3362	"Hopefully in October it does and I think what happens after that is the government is going to allocate land in each and every city to have a public driving range so that a normal human being can go there and try a hand at it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	20	3372	3428	"That's when it's going to be really big in our country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	21	3429	3553	It's the fastest- growing sport in our country, but it's the only way this game is going to get famous and close to cricket. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	22	3563	3661	"Our population is more than a billion and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talent out there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	23	3671	3782	"I don't think there's a public driving range in our country and there's only one public golf course right now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	24	3783	3805	Everything is private. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	25	3815	3957	"I remember there were a lot of good players when I was growing up who just didn't take it up - they just went back to the parents' business." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	26	3967	4153	Last week McIlroy shot 65 at Wentworth before falling back in the final round and it appears injury may have been a factor, although it seems as if he is getting close to finding a cure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	27	4163	4334	McIlroy, who revealed he'd been struggling with a "little niggle" in his back, said: "I had a really nice bath last night, got into bed and watched the golf in the States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	28	4335	4374	I'm a bit of a golf geek to be honest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	0	58	104	South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	1	191	376	The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on the Georgian rebel region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	2	386	612	Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow and Tbilisi and is recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	3	622	851	The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	4	861	1081	Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	5	1091	1149	The Communists were second with 23.51 percent of the vote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	6	1159	1256	Final results were due at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the turnout at 80 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	7	1266	1418	Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	8	1428	1643	The name of Unity also bears more than a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	9	1653	1866	But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	10	1876	2027	Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	11	2037	2103	"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	12	2104	2135	We are working and working now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	13	2136	2202	I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an interview with AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	14	2212	2296	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	15	2306	2368	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	16	2369	2392	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	17	2393	2502	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	18	2512	2624	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	19	2634	2862	As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	20	2872	2998	But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity for his leadership during the August conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	21	3008	3173	"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her ballot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	22	3183	3371	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	23	3381	3524	But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	24	3534	3755	His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	25	3765	3948	As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	26	3958	4149	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	27	4159	4332	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	1	207	369	A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results showed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	2	379	597	The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel region recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	3	607	827	Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	1	189	396	The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	2	406	671	Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for 11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy paperwork, US media reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	3	681	866	Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US automaker would file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	4	876	1125	The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond to the rescue plan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	5	1135	1289	The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	6	1290	1379	Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing everything. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	7	1389	1627	Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	8	1637	1740	Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into its pockets for the rescue plan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	9	1750	1907	Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	10	1917	2029	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	11	2030	2150	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	12	2160	2318	Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that path. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	13	2328	2492	Meanwhile Monday New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on number three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	14	2502	2671	Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	15	2681	2840	The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian governments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	16	2850	2997	Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent; the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	17	3007	3140	The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being closely watched in US political and economic circles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	18	3150	3234	"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	19	3244	3266	"I'm a son of Detroit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	20	3267	3296	My dad was an auto executive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	21	3297	3329	You know, I drive American cars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	22	3330	3351	I love American cars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	23	3352	3457	My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	24	3467	3575	At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half of them in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	25	3585	3774	Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	26	3784	3966	In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is still producing automobiles." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	27	3976	4077	Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome in the private sector. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	28	4087	4234	"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	29	4235	4286	"But I also think there's a need for an exit plan." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	30	4296	4481	The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply embedded in the national imagination. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	31	4491	4671	"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay, leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the Wall Street Journal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	32	4672	4727	"The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	1	185	361	Sicily's city of Palermo was buried in a mountain of waste on Sunday as garbage collectors pressed on with a strike over fears that their struggling employer will not pay them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	2	371	587	Piles of trash as high as two metres (6 feet 5 inches) lined apartment buildings and church walls across the city, as firefighters received reports of some 200 rubbish fires sparked by hot temperatures on the island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	3	597	818	Garbagemen have been on strike or have done limited trash pick-ups as they refuse to work overtime for fear of not getting paid by their employer, the trash collection company Amia, which is 150 million euros in the hole. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	4	828	961	The city council dropped Sunday a plan to raise the waste management tax by 30 percent to help Amia after a stormy municipal meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	5	971	1123	Mayor Diego Cammarata said the strike was "seriously irresponsible" as the city was more and more "invaded by trash in an intolerable and indecent way." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	6	1133	1246	The collectors' union decided to remain on strike until they received guarantees on the future of their employer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	7	1256	1351	They also demanded better work equipment, saying that they were not working in safe conditions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	8	1361	1545	The strike recalls the rubbish problems that have hit Naples, where the mafia has been blamed for a garbage crisis in a city that has been on a "waste state of emergency" for 14 years.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	1	197	363	Organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race announced Sunday changes to the next edition of the round-the-world yacht race aimed at boosting the number of women who take part. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	2	373	601	For the first time in the 36-year history of the event, formerly called the Whitbread race, no women sailors are taking part in the 2008-09 edition of the race, which involves eight teams and began in Alicante, Spain in October. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	3	611	844	Organisers decided that female teams will be allowed to carry 12 sailors, two of whom may be men, instead of just 10 for an all male team during the next edition of the world's most grueling offshore yacht race scheduled for 2011-12. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	4	854	1076	The change in the rules for the crew make-up for the next race was "an effort to encourage female participation", they said in a statement following a meeting in Galway, Ireland where current race entries have made a stop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	5	1086	1331	Specialists say female entries have disappeared from the race due to the selection of the more powerful Volvo Open 70 yachts in 2004, which are longer and require more physical force to control than the old Ocean 60 yachts that were used before. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	6	1341	1509	"These boats are animals," said Lisa McDonald, who attempted to raise a mixed campaign for the last race with her husband Neal after skippering Amer Sports Too in 2001. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	7	1519	1706	"They are wild and furious and pretty powerful so until there is a new rule, it is difficult to imagine girls being competitive in them," she told the Volvo Ocean Race website in January. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	8	1716	1871	The organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race also announced several other changes for future editions designed to make the race more competitive and less costly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	9	1881	2026	The maximum weight for the keel fin and bulb of participating yachts in the future will be set at 7,400 kilogrammes and headfoils will be banned. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	10	2036	2128	Organisers are also looking to ban two-boat testing which favours teams with bigger budgets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	11	2129	2264	One of Swedish team Ericsson's two entries in the ongoing Volvo Ocean Race, the Ericsson 4, currently leads the overall classification. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	12	2274	2400	Volvo is seeking to make it possible for a team to be competitive with a budget of between 15-20 million euros in future race. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	13	2401	2498	They hope lower costs will attract about a dozen teams, instead of the 7 or 8 in recent editions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	14	2508	2644	The current Volvo Ocean Race is to conclude in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in June after negotiating 10 stages over 37,000 nautical miles.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	1	194	337	Millvina Dean, the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, died in a care home in England on Sunday, media reports said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	2	338	349	She was 97. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	3	359	550	Elizabeth Gladys Dean, known to friends as Millvina, was only nine weeks old when the liner hit an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean on the night of April 14, 1912, and sank killing 1,500 people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	4	560	628	She survived after being bundled up in a sack and carried to safety. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	5	629	744	Her mother Georgette Eva and brother Bertram also made it, but her father, Bertram Frank, was among those who died. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	6	754	922	Dean died in a private nursing home near Ashurst in the southern English county of Hampshire, according to the BBC and Britain's domestic Press Association news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	7	923	966	Staff there refused to comment late Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	8	976	1113	Dean's family had boarded the Titanic at Southampton, heading for a new life in Kansas where her father hoped to open a tobacconist shop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	9	1123	1191	Born on February 12, 1912, Dean was the youngest passenger on board. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	10	1192	1308	At the time, RMS Titanic was the most luxurious, most technically advanced and largest passenger liner in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	11	1318	1496	She was dubbed "unsinkable", but it took just two hours and 40 minutes for her to disappear into the icy waters of the Atlantic after striking an iceberg at 11:40 pm on April 14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	12	1506	1693	Dean was taken back to Southampton with her family after the disaster and did not find out that she had been on board until she was eight years old and her mother was planning to remarry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	13	1703	1870	According to enthusiasts' website Encyclopedia Titanica (ET), Dean worked for the government as a cartographer during World War II and then for an engineering company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	14	1880	2060	She told reporters that it was not until the wreckage of the liner was found in 1985 that she suddenly became a celebrity, taking part in documentaries and giving media interviews. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	15	2070	2302	Dean was invited to complete her family's ill-fated journey to the United States in 1997 aboard the QE2, and accepted, although she turned down an offer to attend the premier of the movie "Titanic" because it would be too upsetting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	16	2312	2488	She moved into a private nursing home in Hampshire after breaking her hip three years ago, and after struggling to pay the bills was forced to sell off some of her memorabilia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	17	2498	2719	At auction in October 2008 she raised 31,150 pounds (40,000 euros, 53,900 dollars), selling off rare prints of the liner signed by the artists as well as compensation letters sent to her mother by the Titanic Relief Fund. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	18	2729	2888	Dean was also forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes donated to her family by the people of New York when they arrived after being rescued. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	19	2898	3110	In the wake of the auction, friends including members of the British Titanic Society and the Belfast Titanic Society -- the liner was built in Belfast in Northern Ireland-- set up a campaign to secure her future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	20	3120	3255	Among the donors to the Millvina Fund were Hollywood actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, who starred in the 1997 "Titanic" film. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	21	3256	3351	The pair and the film's director, James Cameron, reportedly donated 30,000 US dollars in total. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	22	3361	3456	The last remaining US survivor, Lillian Asplund, died in her home in May 2006 at the age of 99.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	1	191	376	The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on the Georgian rebel region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	2	386	612	Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow and Tbilisi and is recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	3	622	851	The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	4	861	1084	Based on an initial count of almost eight percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	8	1420	1635	The name of Unity also bears more that a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	9	1645	1858	But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	13	2128	2194	I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an interview with AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	14	2204	2288	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	15	2298	2360	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	16	2361	2384	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	17	2385	2494	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	18	2504	2616	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	19	2626	2854	As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	20	2864	2990	But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity for his leadership during the August conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	21	3000	3165	"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her ballot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	22	3175	3363	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	23	3373	3516	But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	24	3526	3747	His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	25	3757	3940	As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	26	3950	4141	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing term limits in its constitution.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	1	179	382	Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak will try to heal a growing rift with his country's main ally over the Middle East peace process when he starts talks with top officials in the United States on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	2	392	613	Barak is likely to devote a lot of time to easing tensions, although the talks were originally planned to focus mainly on bilateral defence ties and US-led international efforts to halt Iran's nuclear drive, an aide said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	3	623	851	During the three-day trip, he is expected to meet Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, National Security Adviser James Jones and President Barack Obama's special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	4	861	1108	The defence chief is also expected to discuss US arms sales to Israel, including a request for it to buy up to 75 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in a deal worth as much as 15.2 billion dollars and other advanced weapon systems, a senior official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	5	1118	1320	Barak's visit comes just two weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held his first meeting with Obama in Washington, revealing deep divisions over ways to move forwards towards Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	6	1330	1539	The hawkish premier sparked international criticism over his repeated refusal to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, a bedrock principle of international peacemaking efforts over the past two decades. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	7	1549	1724	Tensions have intensified, with Israel rejecting repeated US calls to halt all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, the major part of the proposed Palestinian state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	8	1734	1943	Barak, a former prime minister and head of the centre-left Labour party, aims to use his personal ties to avert a crisis between Washington and Netanyahu's right-leaning government, a senior official told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	9	1953	2152	But it remains unclear whether Barak will be able to ease the tensions as he himself has said that Israel must maintain its right to continue building within the boundaries of large settlement blocs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	10	2162	2261	"It seems that the prime minister made Israel's positions and needs clear to the US administration. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	11	2262	2365	The dialogue will take time and it will have many ups and downs," the Labour leader has told reporters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	12	2375	2605	One official said Barak will propose that within a short time Israel would dismantle dozens of illegal outposts in the West Bank if the United States lets Israel go on building inside existing settlements to meet "natural growth." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	13	2615	2807	A senior Israeli official complained that Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- is placing unfair demands on the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	14	2817	2945	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	15	2946	3011	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	16	3021	3278	Despite discord over the Middle East peace talks, Obama eased Israeli concerns over his efforts to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear programme in direct negotiations, with the president saying the success of the dialogue would be assessed by the year's end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	17	3288	3408	"This dialogue ought to be short and should have milestones to check whether it is serious or not," Barak said recently. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	18	3409	3492	"I believe the chances that talks will halt Iran's nuclear programme are very low." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	19	3502	3632	The former chief of staff reiterated that Israel would not rule out military action against nuclear sites in the Islamic republic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	20	3642	3717	"Israel believes that no option should be removed from the table," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	21	3727	3921	Israel, widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power, suspects Iran is using its nuclear programme to develop atomic weapons, a charge Tehran has long denied.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	1	193	382	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	2	392	620	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	3	630	777	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	4	787	877	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	5	887	1030	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	6	1040	1173	However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was impossible to estimate when the offensive would end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	7	1183	1289	"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot give any timeframe," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	8	1299	1505	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	9	1515	1745	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	10	1755	1870	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	11	1871	1975	The attack was repulsed successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	12	1985	2208	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	13	2218	2446	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	14	2456	2589	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	15	2599	2816	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	16	2826	3042	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	17	3052	3245	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	18	3255	3352	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	19	3353	3477	The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	20	3487	3597	As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	21	3607	3805	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	22	3815	4018	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	23	4028	4249	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	24	4259	4456	Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the situation in Swat Valley, after an ICRC team reported problems with running water, food, electricty and communications. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	25	4466	4622	"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	26	4632	4806	"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our teams to deliver."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	1	181	371	The final report on staging provincial elections in Iraq's disputed region of Kirkuk has been delayed by another week because of disagreements among commission members, an MP said on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	2	381	637	"The commission on Sunday notified parliament speaker Iyad al-Samarrai that it had not succeeded in reaching a compromise" acceptable to Kirkuk's Kurdish, Turkmen and Arab communities, Mohammad Mahdi al-Bayati, a Turkmen member of the commission, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	3	647	797	Samarrai asked commission members "to continue their mission another week" and said he will submit "his own suggestions for a solution," Bayati added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	4	807	917	Arabs and Turkmen oppose to any further extension beyond a week although the Kurds have no objection, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	5	927	1066	The commission should have delivered its report on elections in the province by mid-April, but the deadline was put back to the end of May. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	6	1076	1177	Oil-rich Kirkuk, 250 kilometres (150 miles) north of the capital, has a population of around 900,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	7	1187	1385	The Arab and Turkmen communities want seats on the provincial council to be divided into three equal blocs, but the Kurds say they form the majority of the population and want better representation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	8	1395	1569	Intercommunal tensions prevented the staging of provincial elections in Kirkuk on January 31, when the rest of Iraq except the three Kurdish provinces voted for new councils.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	1	186	381	Hundreds of Bulgarians protested Sunday outside the Polish embassy in Sofia to voice their fury over a tug-of-love saga which saw an eight-year-old girl taken back into the custody of her mother. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	2	391	620	The crowd, numbering more than a thousand, denounced both Barbara Jadwigd, the Polish mother of Nikoleta Vasilev, and embassy officials who helped her retrieve the eight-year-old from her father's home in line with a court order. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	3	630	862	Emotions have been running high since a report on the private Nova channel last week showed how Jadwigd had dragged her sobbing daughter into an embassy car outside her father's home in the southeastern Bulgarian town of Asenovgrad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	4	872	1008	As Nikoleta screamed for help from her father and grandmother, her seven-year- old brother Pavel managed to escape and is still missing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	5	1018	1157	Jadwigd had obtained custody rights in a court case after accusing the father, Todor Vasilev, of kidnapping them from their home in Poland. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	6	1167	1286	The father denied having taken the children to Bulgaria against their will, and accused Jadwigd of being a poor parent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	7	1296	1515	Many Bulgarian politicians, including European Affairs Minister Gergana Passi, have denounced the mother's behaviour while recognising the fact that a court had indeed granted her the right to take them from the father. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	8	1525	1787	The Polish embassy in Sofia meanwhile published a statement on its website saying that it "regrets the fact that some media reports on this case are far from objective ... and cause unnecessary emotions in the society that do not contribute to solving the case." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	9	1797	1990	"The Bulgarian court ruled at two instances that the children must be returned to the place from which they were kidnapped, against the will and in the absence of one of the parents," it added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	1	185	375	Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has been ruled out of France's forthcoming friendly matches against Nigeria and Turkey due to a knee injury, France coach Raymond Domenech revealed on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	2	385	514	France have not yet decided to call up any replacements for the home games against Nigeria on June 2 and Turkey three days later. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	3	524	757	Henry, 31, played in Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final in Rome on Wednesday, having overcome a knee ligament injury sustained in the Spanish champions' 6-2 thrashing of Real Madrid on May 2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	4	767	863	"I expected it a little bit," Domenech said on the French Football Federation website on Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0082	21	2297	2432	The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0082	23	2627	2776	As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0083	9	1224	1405	"We played poorly at times but the one thing we do is try pretty hard and because we do that we give ourselves chances to win games at the end and fortunately we did that this time.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	2	377	598	Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0 lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	3	608	801	But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	4	811	1011	Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Shabab. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	5	1021	1235	Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	6	1245	1434	All the goals were brilliantly executed by a team who scored four goals each in previous home encounters against USM of Gabon and Union Douala of Cameroon having received a first round bye. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	7	1444	1645	Bebucho strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable 30-metre shot past goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh, Milex volleyed a loose ball into the net from close range and Saul clinically sidefooted home a cross. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	8	1655	1884	Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	9	1894	2124	Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria, Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	10	2134	2331	The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million supporters in Egypt and the Middle East. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	11	2341	2550	It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	12	2560	2768	The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign coach to have worked at club level on the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	13	2778	2991	Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	8	1107	1313	The shooting came just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic universities in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	9	1323	1528	The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	13	1958	2134	Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested outside his clinic.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	16	2302	2370	Tiller recovered, and his assailant received an 11-year prison term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	17	2380	2482	Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long demonstrations in 1991. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	18	2492	2629	He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in 2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	19	2639	2838	Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in 1994 that listed Tiller as the top target. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0111	20	2848	3042	Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the mother's womb.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	1	189	354	AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo Maldini and Carlo Ancelotti a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	2	364	604	The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	3	614	798	That was immediately followed by Ancelotti announcing he was leaving the club, who then replaced him with technical director Leonardo, a former player and World Cup winner with Brazil. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	4	808	976	Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home win over Lazio. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	5	986	1217	But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti avoided that by making his announcement to Sky Sport TV cameras after the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	6	1227	1383	He claimed it was a mutual decision taken with club vice-president Adriano Galliani, although he refused to confirm he would be joining Chelsea next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	7	1393	1448	"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	8	1449	1474	Our paths are separating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	9	1475	1565	I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate the contract," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	10	1575	1668	"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and it was mutual. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	11	1669	1709	London is not certain as a destination." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	12	1719	1915	Fiorentina, who had to win to take a top three finish, started brightly and former Milan forward Alberto Gilardino got on the end of a left-wing cross on 22-minutes but headed wide under pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	13	1925	2069	Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	14	2079	2231	Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	15	2241	2358	On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the post with the outside of his right boot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	16	2368	2584	But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	17	2594	2730	Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	18	2740	2881	However substitute Pato did seal the victory on 76 minutes as he beat the offside trap and then chipped Frey as the Frenchman went to ground.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	20	3043	3162	Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimvoic also took the golden boot award after his two goals took his tally to 25 this season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	21	3172	3219	"You can't do better than that, I'm very happy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	22	3220	3260	I worked really hard for this," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	23	3270	3356	"When  arrived in Italy people said I was a great player but didn't score many goals." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	24	3366	3530	Ibrahimovic refused to commit his future to Inter despite speculation surrounding a possible move to Spain, however coach Jose Mourinho insisted his man would stay. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	25	3540	3621	"I continue to think that next year Ibra will still be an Inter player," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	1	193	400	French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times, pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	2	410	610	The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	3	620	721	Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a large electric output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	4	731	881	These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	5	891	1106	That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	6	1116	1228	But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the relative slowness of magnetic sensors. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	7	1238	1532	In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	8	1542	1724	"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage surface, Bigot told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	9	1734	1832	Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a second, said Bigot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	10	1842	2013	Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10 centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics, he cautioned. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	11	2023	2117	Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over the next decade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	12	2127	2218	IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research, Bigot said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	0	58	99	First genes spotted for testicular cancer 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	1	172	348	Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between the ages of 15 and 45. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	2	358	573	Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730 men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	3	583	706	Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	4	716	777	The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	5	787	1097	"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of Surrey. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	6	1107	1211	"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working on identifying the rest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	7	1221	1328	The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are precursors in sperm development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	8	1338	1516	Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said in a press release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	9	1526	1552	Why this is so is unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	10	1553	1657	Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and seems to be far higher than for other cancer types. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	11	1667	1867	Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of patients, the risk is four to six times higher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	12	1877	1961	Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	1	189	425	Former Real Madrid president Florentino Perez could automatically take charge again of Spain's historically most successful team on Monday if no other candidate throws in his hat to run for president by a deadline of midnight on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	2	435	656	The 62-year-old, who led Real from 2000 to 2006, was the only candidate for the post after former club vice-president Juan Onieva withdrew his candidacy last week, saying his proposed programme had not been well received. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	3	666	860	Under Perez, Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	4	870	1021	He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is back" and said the team he would help to build would be world beaters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	5	1031	1088	"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	6	1089	1263	We have set up a strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	7	1273	1527	Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	8	1537	1693	"I do not place any limit on myself," he said in an interview published Sunday in top-selling daily newspaper El Pais, adding the club "needs a revolution". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	9	1703	1877	Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the Spanish Cup in a superb season under debutant coach Pep Guardiola that left Real looking ordinary by comparison. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	10	1887	1973	But Perez said the success of Real's arch-rivals this season "motivates me even more". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	11	1983	2065	If there is more than one candidate for president, a vote will be held on June 14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	12	2075	2257	While the club normally holds elections every four years, it faces the prospect of holding a ballot a year early due to the resignation of former president Ramon Calderon in January. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	13	2267	2397	That followed allegations he rigged voting at the club's last general assembly in December, which approved its financial accounts.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	1	195	360	Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	2	370	555	In one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament, the Spanish king of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	3	565	788	Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round victory came just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	4	798	1010	But he was a man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	5	1020	1198	"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be," said Nadal who had won the Monte Carlo, Rome and Barcelona events in the run-up to Roland Garros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	6	1208	1231	"I didn't play my best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	7	1232	1274	I played very short and I couldn't attack. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	8	1275	1319	I made it easy for him to play at his level. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	9	1320	1331	But I lost. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	10	1341	1384	"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	11	1385	1466	I must accept my defeats with the same level of calm that I accept my victories." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	12	1476	1510	Soderling was in tears by the end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	13	1520	1643	"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said the Swede who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	14	1653	1677	"I'm so proud of myself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	15	1678	1775	This is the best win of my career against a man who is the greatest claycourt player in history." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	16	1785	1938	Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	17	1948	2142	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	18	2152	2358	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	19	2368	2455	The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	20	2465	2650	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	21	2660	2814	With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	22	2824	2970	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	23	2980	3143	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	25	3257	3470	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	26	3480	3576	Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to the Spaniard's 33. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	27	3586	3739	His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	28	3749	3911	Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand Slam.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	1	181	329	AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	2	339	592	Ancelotti told Italian Sky Sport TV of his departure following the 2-0 win at Fiorentina that ensured the seven-time European champions finished third and avoided having to play two qualifying rounds to reach next season's Champions League group stages. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	3	602	699	At the same time, Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was announcing his replacement on Rai TV. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	4	709	939	Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had become the worst-kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure, but he refused to confirm that English side Chelsea would be his destination. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	5	949	1041	"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end," said a visibly emotional Ancelotti. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	6	1051	1077	"Our paths are separating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	7	1078	1158	I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate the contract. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	8	1168	1261	"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and it was mutual. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	9	1262	1302	London is not certain as a destination." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	10	1312	1551	Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but has received heavy criticism in the last two years for failing to mount a serious challenge to champions Inter Milan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	11	1561	1760	But he will remain a legend at the club where he also won two European Cups as a player, thus becoming one of the few people in history to claim Europe's premier competition as both player and coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	12	1770	1874	He also played for Parma and Roma and coached Reggiana, Parma and Juventus before joining Milan in 2001. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	13	1884	1951	Meanwhile Galliani told Rai: "Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	14	1952	2012	He will be officially presented tomorrow (Monday) at midday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	15	2022	2064	"With Ancelotti the story is not finished. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	16	2065	2126	We will stay friends, we had eight marvellous years together. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	17	2136	2221	"Carlo and I are very good friends and there were a few tears in the changing rooms." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	18	2231	2359	Leonardo had long been tipped to take over from Ancelotti, with Friday's Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that it was a done deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	19	2369	2486	The 39-year-old former midfielder and left-back played for the club from 1997-2001, winning the league title in 1999. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	20	2496	2770	He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994, although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game suspension that saw him miss the final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	21	2780	2965	Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his debut season in charge of the Catalans.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	1	203	358	Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	2	368	542	The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	3	552	690	He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	4	700	834	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	5	844	1019	"Once I got onto the slicks I found a good feeling immediately and I was able to get to the front quite quickly, but then I started having a problem with the clutch," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	6	1029	1087	"It was a really hard race and I just wanted to finish it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	7	1088	1191	I just tried to stay smooth and keep the same lap times even if I couldn’t ride the way I wanted to." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	8	1201	1427	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	9	1437	1537	Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for the harder compound. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	10	1547	1607	"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	11	1608	1687	The race was really difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	12	1697	1756	"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	13	1757	1822	The choice of hards was made even though I wanted the soft ones." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	14	1832	1938	Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap and skidded at the start. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	15	1948	2064	"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can't really believe the race today, it was like a movie," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	16	2074	2207	"It's a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today, so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	17	2208	2243	I'm really happy with this result." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	18	2253	2339	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a second. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	19	2349	2458	In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and immediately dropped to eighth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	20	2468	2665	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	21	2675	2786	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	22	2796	2903	However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was clearly fastest in the wet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	23	2913	3042	Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	24	3052	3201	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	25	3211	3388	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	26	3398	3603	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits essentially cost either of them a chance of victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	27	3613	3832	While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	28	3842	4021	Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the pits to change his bike. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	29	4031	4203	It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into their new tyres.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	1	196	314	Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	2	324	391	Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	3	401	527	Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	4	537	647	But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before Kirmond crossed to snatch the win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	5	657	836	Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it 6-6 at the break. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	6	846	942	Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left stunned at the death. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	7	952	1085	On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	8	1095	1197	In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with three drop goal attempts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	9	1207	1337	However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	10	1347	1517	The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the last four. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	11	1527	1676	The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished 24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	12	1686	1820	The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	13	1830	1951	The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson, which saw the first-half finish all square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	14	1961	2149	Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	15	2159	2321	The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in front. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	16	2331	2477	A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	17	2487	2596	St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try 66-6 victory over Gateshead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	18	2606	2785	The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery grabbed doubles for Saints. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	19	2795	2902	Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence with a 28-6 win over Salford. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	20	2912	3027	Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of tries and eight points with the boot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	21	3037	3165	In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	1	186	358	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday appointed a new envoy to head indirect negotiations on a prisoner swap with the Islamist Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	2	368	596	Hagai Hadas, a former commander in the Mossad spy agency, will oversee talks on the release of soldier Gilad Shalit, held in Gaza since his capture by Palestinian militants in June 2006, the premier's office said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	3	606	806	Hamas and Israel blame each other for the failure of negotiations in Cairo in mid-March aimed at securing a deal under which Israel would free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	4	816	983	Ofer Dekel, the previous Israeli prisoner negotiator who was appointed by former prime minister Ehud Olmert, stepped down shortly after Netanyahu took office in March. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	5	993	1212	The talks on a swap have not resumed since Netanyahu's right-leaning government took office at the start of April, and the premier has so far refused to say whether he accepts the framework of the previous negotiations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	6	1222	1418	Israel, which launched a devastating 22-day onslaught on Hamas in Gaza in December, has made the release of Shalit a precondition for a lasting ceasefire and an end to its blockade of the enclave. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	7	1428	1516	A corporal at the time of his capture, Shalit has since been promoted to staff sergeant.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	1	176	375	Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	2	385	549	The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai 6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	3	559	758	Also through and into her first Grand Slam quarter-final was Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova who had too much movement about the court and allround ability for Agnes Szavay of Hungary winning 6-2, 6-4. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	4	768	985	She will play the winner of the day's remaining fourth round tie between former world No 1 Maria Sharpova of Russia and Li Na who is bidding to become the first Chinese player to reach the last eight at Roland Garros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	5	995	1151	Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she has won three titles this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	6	1161	1335	Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it was all but over. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	7	1345	1546	With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	8	1556	1637	Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her opponent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	9	1647	1756	"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little bit more for me now," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	10	1766	1863	"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a big step for me. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	11	1873	2010	"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	12	2020	2095	Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	13	2105	2232	"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	14	2233	2264	It was really hard after that." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	15	2274	2456	Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that she is a worthy world No.1. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	16	2466	2662	But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	17	2672	2740	"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	18	2750	2890	"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	19	2900	2959	"Since I became number one I am playing better and better." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	20	2969	3119	Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	21	3129	3298	Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit, dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out into a 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	22	3308	3497	The Hungarian, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	23	3507	3722	Cibulkova wiped out an early break against her in the second set as she won five games in a row but failed to convert a match point in the following game and had to wait till her next service game to wrap things up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	24	3732	3887	She will next go up against the winner of the tie between Sharapova and Li knowing that she has already taken a step up the career ladder at Roland Garros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	25	3897	3954	"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	26	3964	4072	"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	27	4073	4095	But now it's amazing."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0143	3	475	617	He was shot to death just after 10 am (1500 GMT) as he walked into Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, the Wichita Eagle reported.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	1	180	338	AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	2	348	465	While Ancelotti was telling Italian Sky Sport TV that he was leaving, Galliani was announcing his replacement to Rai. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	3	475	513	"Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	4	514	647	He will be officially presented tomorrow (Monday) at midday," he told them, confirming a claim made in Friday's Gazzetta dello Sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	5	657	742	The 39-year-old played for the club from 1997-2001, winning the league title in 1999. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	6	752	1026	He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994, although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game suspension that saw him miss the final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0145	7	1036	1215	Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his season in charge of the Catalans.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	1	174	369	Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and attorney general to quit immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	2	379	599	In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	3	609	912	The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	4	922	994	However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	5	1004	1270	"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith," the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also Zimbabwe's finance minister. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	6	1280	1554	Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power- sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its supporters by pro-Mugabe militias. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	7	1564	1815	The party said the government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow implementation of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the military in villages and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the government payroll." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	8	1825	1958	The prime minister sought to reassure his supporters at the end of the conference saying he had not abandoned the party's objectives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	9	1968	2172	"The transitional government, which is a coalition government is a stepping stone to a new and democratic Zimbabwe," he said but expressing disappoitment at delays in implementing the coalition agreement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	10	2182	2293	"We are disappointed at the pace of the implementation of some of the issues in the global political agreement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	11	2303	2370	"The party's agenda must not be diluted by the government's agenda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	12	2371	2512	We must also acknowledge that in a marriage like this there are likely to be compromises but we must not demobilise saying 'we have arrived.' 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	13	2513	2592	We must continue to streng our party structures in preparations for elections." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	14	2602	2779	The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into world record inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	15	2789	2928	Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	16	2938	3108	Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's followers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	17	3118	3214	The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of political violence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	18	3224	3412	"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the welfare of victims," the party said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	1	181	318	Carlo Ancelotti announced he was quitting AC Milan following their 2-0 win at Fiorentina on the last day of the Serie A season on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	2	328	515	Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani then announced that former player and Brazil World Cup winning midfielder Leonardo, the club's technical director, would be taking over the hot-seat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	3	525	685	A visibly emotional Ancelotti, who is widely tipped to take over at Chelsea, told Italian Sky Sport TV: "Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	4	695	916	Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had become the worst kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure, however he refused to confirm that Chelsea would be his destination. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	5	926	952	"Our paths are separating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	6	953	1033	I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate the contract. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	7	1043	1136	"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and it was mutual. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	8	1146	1187	"London is not certain as a destination." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	9	1197	1420	Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but was coming under heavy criticism the last two years for failing to push champions Inter Milan closer.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	1	178	343	Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	2	353	533	In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	3	543	753	Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	4	763	973	But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	5	983	1116	"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said a tearful Soderling who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	6	1126	1150	"I'm so proud of myself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	7	1151	1247	This is the best win of my career against a man who is the greatest claycourt player in history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	8	1248	1318	But I told myself before the match that I had to believe I could win." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	9	1328	1481	Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	10	1491	1685	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	11	1695	1901	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	12	1911	1998	The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	13	2008	2193	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	14	2203	2357	With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	15	2367	2513	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	16	2523	2686	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	17	2696	2790	He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep Soderling drive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	18	2800	3013	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	19	3023	3119	Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to the Spaniard's 33. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	20	3129	3282	His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	21	3292	3454	Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand Slam.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	1	203	358	Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	2	368	542	The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	3	552	690	He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	4	700	800	Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for the harder compound. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	5	810	870	"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	6	871	950	The race was really difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	7	960	1019	"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	8	1020	1085	The choice of hards was made even though I wanted the soft ones." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	9	1095	1201	Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap and skidded at the start. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	10	1211	1329	"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can’t really believe the race today, it was like a movie," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	11	1339	1477	"This morning in the warm-up I was quite worried because I was slow in the rain, then on the formation lap I slid off into the gravel pit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	12	1487	1560	"On the grid I tried not to think about the crash, I just tried to focus. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	13	1561	1656	But then I had a big slide off the line and the first part of the race wasn’t so good for me.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	16	1849	1983	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	17	1993	2219	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	18	2229	2315	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a second. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	19	2325	2434	In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and immediately dropped to eighth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	20	2444	2641	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	21	2651	2762	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	22	2772	2879	However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was clearly fastest in the wet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	23	2889	3018	Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	24	3028	3177	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	25	3187	3364	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	26	3374	3580	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits, essentially cost either of them a chance of victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	27	3590	3809	While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	28	3819	3998	Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the pits to change his bike.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	1	184	296	Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday following the 14.4 kilometres time-trial round. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	2	306	445	The Rabobank cyclist - who is the third Russian to win the race - won despite suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the stage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	3	455	580	Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca finished second with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	4	590	776	Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time of 18min 42sec with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald Boasson Hagen in third. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	5	786	839	Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	6	849	974	The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest ever finishes to a Giro, in it's centenary year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	7	984	1120	Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the first time check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	8	1130	1258	But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	9	1268	1454	When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last Thursday, was getting stronger. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	10	1464	1599	The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	11	1609	1713	Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed with just 1km left to ride. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	12	1723	1797	However quick thinking from his mechanic may have secured him the victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	13	1807	1956	As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	14	1966	2161	Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy of a push from the mechanic as well. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	15	2171	2324	He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca and despite the crash he gained 21sec on his rival to win by 41sec overall. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	16	2334	2480	Pellizotti finished just under two minutes down with Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre fourth and seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong 12th.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	1	192	379	Senior Red Cross officials who visited Pakistan's Swat Valley said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the humanitarian situation as Pakistani soldiers battled to crush the Taliban. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	2	389	665	"The organisation is gravely concerned about the plight of civilians in Swat and believes their situation demands a prompt and comprehensive humanitarian response," said a statement released from the Geneva headquarters of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	3	675	810	"The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	4	820	1004	"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our teams to deliver," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	5	1014	1226	Aid workers had been alarmed at what they saw when they entered the region, where the fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters for the pass month has left civilians trapped and isolated for weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	6	1236	1361	"There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce," said Daniel O'Malley, who led the IRCR team into the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	7	1371	1517	"Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	8	1527	1667	Red Cross workers were also disturbed at conditions in Khwazakhela hospital, one of the few medical facilities still left operating in Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	9	1677	1795	"The handful of hospital staff left are struggling to work without any water, electricity or supplies," said O'Malley. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	10	1805	1859	"They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	11	1869	1923	The Red Cross evacuated 14 patients from the hospital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	12	1933	2066	Pakistan's defence secretary Syed Athar Ali said Sunday the army was gaining on the Taliban and fighting could be over in a few days. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	13	2076	2266	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	14	2276	2405	The defence chief told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	15	2415	2566	"Only five to 10 percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	16	2576	2709	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	17	2719	2889	Also Sunday the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	18	2899	3063	The ICRC is one of the very few humanitarian organizations working in Swat before the conflict broke out and has been trying to return there since early this month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	19	3064	3155	Despite some openings it said access to areas affected by the fighting remains too limited. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	20	3165	3328	It also continues to support camps run by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, where over 20,000 people driven from their homes by the fighting are currently living.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	1	178	343	Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	2	353	533	In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	3	543	753	Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	4	763	973	But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	5	983	1136	Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	6	1146	1340	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	7	1350	1556	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	8	1566	1653	The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	9	1663	1848	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	10	1858	2012	With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	11	2022	2168	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	12	2178	2341	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	13	2351	2445	He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep Soderling drive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	14	2455	2668	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	15	2678	2831	His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	16	2841	3003	Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand Slam. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0155	17	3013	3077	He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	1	192	395	Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was plotting her future Sunday after her defeat in the "Britain's Got Talent" television show, which made her a worldwide star thanks to Internet exposure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	2	405	616	Boyle, a frumpy, 48-year-old church volunteer, will reportedly earn up to eight million pounds (nine million euros, 13 million dollars) in the next year from a record deal, a book about her life and even a film. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	3	626	813	She is set to start rehearsing for an album of showtunes this week and will fly to Prague next month for recording sessions with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, British media said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	4	823	1002	Boyle's career looks likely to reach new heights even though she lost to the multi-ethnic street dancers Diversity in a public vote after the live talent show final late Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	5	1012	1102	Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges, she was forced into second place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	6	1103	1184	The "best people won", she said, wishing the dance troupe winners "all the best". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	7	1194	1313	After the contest, "Britain's Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan called her "the greatest discovery the show's ever found". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	8	1323	1543	He added: "I'm only sorry that the extraordinary tidal wave of publicity she attracted meant so many people got either bored or irritated by Boyle mania and decided not to vote for her as a result," he wrote on his blog. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	9	1553	1753	Boyle has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	10	1763	1977	It has had at least 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi, who embraced the dowdy spinster from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	11	1987	2212	Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final performance, there were fears that Boyle, who was starved of oxygen at birth and has mild learning difficulties, was suffering under the pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	12	2222	2426	She was spoken to by police after an outburst at the London hotel where she was staying, while Morgan described her as "a frightened rabbit in headlights" and said she had considered quitting the contest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	13	2436	2557	But in a live performance in the final Saturday, she proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	14	2567	2728	Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress -- was asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	15	2729	2780	I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	16	2790	2882	As for her future plans, she added: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just play it by ear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	17	2883	2934	What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	18	2944	3067	A total of 19.2 million people watched the show in Britain, making it the most popular television programme for five years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	19	3077	3196	Just under four million people voted, broadcaster ITV said, with 24.9 percent backing Diversity and 20.2 percent Boyle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	20	3206	3385	Boyle's performance was also watched by hundreds of fans in her home town of Blackburn, outside Edinburgh, where she lives in social housing with only her cat Pebbles for company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	21	3395	3580	"She told me that after the final, she wants to come back and resume her previous life," one of Boyle's neighbours, 24-year-old housewife Vicky McLean told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	22	3590	3667	"She doesn't want to make millions and go to America, she just wants to sing.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	1	181	378	Pakistan captain Younus Khan said the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in England had a special significance for his side after their country had become a virtual 'no-go zone' for international cricket. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	2	388	526	A terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March saw seven of their players and English assistant coach Paul Farbrace injured.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	4	616	842	With no international side willing to travel to Pakistan, Younus's men recently returned to international action in the United Arab Emirates against Australia, where they lost 3-2 in a one-day series but won the lone Twenty20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	5	852	1045	"It is special to be back on the world stage, especially in Twenty20 and in England, the media are here so lots of hopes are here," the talented batsman told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	6	1055	1145	"We are suffering from not playing regularly, and no-one is coming to Pakistan," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	7	1155	1355	Pakistan endured a nailbiting defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India in the 2007 World Twenty20 final in South Africa and Younus would love nothing more than for his team to go one better this time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	8	1365	1432	"My confidence is that I'll take this trophy to Pakistan," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	9	1433	1577	But such has been Pakistan's relative lack of international cricket that he added: "It will be an achievement for us to finish in the top four." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	10	1587	1668	Reflecting on the 2007 final, Younus said: "The finishing touches were not there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	11	1669	1694	We needed only five runs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	12	1695	1755	But it was fantastic to be a part of that team in the final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	13	1765	1861	"Some guys were crying at the end, but hopefully we'll have the finishing touches," Younus said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	14	1871	2096	Twenty20 tends to put a premium on big-hitting batsmen at the start of the innings but Younus, whose team face England and the Netherlands in Group B, said it was not necessary to start going for big shots right from the off.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	1	184	379	Myanmar's military junta accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit back against the "bullying" generals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	2	389	600	The regime said the Nobel laureate was not above the law and issued its sternest warning yet against foreign interference in the case, under which she faces up to five years' jail for breaching her house arrest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	3	610	839	Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed prison trial, insisting that she only offered "temporary shelter" to American John Yettaw after he swam to her lakeside house, and has branded the proceedings as biased. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	4	849	1101	"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned," Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security forum in Singapore. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	5	1111	1211	"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the law," Aye Myint said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	13	1897	2108	"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got into the property)," party spokesman Nyan Win told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	15	2158	2243	She said it was unjust bullying," added Nyan Win, who is also part of her legal team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	16	2253	2443	Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May 6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers and spending two nights there.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	18	2652	2885	Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement to the court this week that she could not be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	1	194	393	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party before crunch European and local elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	2	403	490	He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I believe in". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	3	500	603	Every lawmaker would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last four years, he promised. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	4	613	732	Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said they will resign since the scandal broke. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	5	742	893	The leaked expenses claims have shown that Members of Parliament have claimed from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	6	903	1099	A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested that three weeks of revelations by the Daily Telegraph newspaper would hit Brown hard at the European and local elections, in which Britons vote Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	7	1109	1280	It suggested Labour would come third in the European elections with just 17 percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and second opposition centrist Liberal Democrats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	8	1290	1475	Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in an opinion poll since 1987. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	9	1485	1626	Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	10	1636	1696	ICM interviewed 1,013 adults by telephone between May 27-28. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	11	1706	1893	But Brown, who must call a general election by the middle of next year, dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader in an interview with BBC television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	12	1903	1936	"Things go up and down," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	13	1937	2022	"We're going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	14	2032	2254	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	15	2264	2498	He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, lowering the voting age to 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	16	2508	2654	Brown said he did not accept the case for an unelected House of Lords and said he was always open to arguments for reforming of the voting system. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	17	2664	2794	Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	18	2804	2969	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in 2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among many. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	19	2979	3113	This time, fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far- right British National Party are expected to benefit.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	1	187	382	Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and attorney general to quit immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	2	392	612	In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	3	622	925	The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	4	935	1007	However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	5	1017	1283	"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith," the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also Zimbabwe's finance minister. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	6	1293	1567	Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power- sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its supporters by pro-Mugabe militias. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	7	1577	1822	The government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow implementation of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the military in villages and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the government payroll," it said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	8	1832	2009	The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into world record inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	9	2019	2158	Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	10	2168	2338	Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's followers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	11	2348	2444	The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of political violence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	12	2454	2642	"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the welfare of victims," the party said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	3	533	690	The 21-year-old Ivanovic, meanwhile, was left pondering what she has to do to re-discover the form that brought her the title and world No.1 spot a year ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	4	700	843	Azarenka, with three titles to her name this year already, was the first to break thanks to a blistering crosscourt backhand in the third game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	5	853	1010	Ivanovic, who has battled for form and fitness since her triumph here last year, had her chances to break back in the following game but failed to take them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	6	1020	1202	She paid the penalty for that three games later when Azarenka collected a second break of serve forcing her opponent to hit long on break point at the end of a long, punishing rally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	7	1212	1321	Azarenka, a former world junior No.1, comfortably served out for the set despite opening with a double fault. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	8	1331	1509	Both players were wearing high-tech strapping on their knees, the right for Ivanovic and the left for Azarenko, a clear sign of the injury epidemic that has beset women's tennis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	9	1519	1711	Ivanovic was put under severe pressure on her serve again at the start of the second set and after saving a handful of break points she finally succumbed by hitting a forehand a fraction long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	10	1721	1865	That was all Azarenka needed to further assert her authority in the match with Ivanovic looking increasingly out of sorts and unsure of herself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	11	1875	1990	The crowd were firmly behind the Serb, but it made no difference as Azarenko jumped out into a commanding 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	12	2000	2169	Ivanovic did manage to claw two games back to get to 4-2, but Azarenka snuffed out any hope she had of a comeback by breaking the Serbian's serve again in the next game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	13	2179	2304	She failed to serve out for the match but broke Ivanovic for the sixth time in the match in the following game to go through.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	1	166	332	Kuwait's Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah al-Sabah said on Sunday the OPEC member does not favour a high price for oil because this would dampen the global economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	2	342	508	"We are not in favour to see the prices in the hundreds (of dollars a barrel) because this will fuel recession again," the minister told reporters outside parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	3	518	744	He said Kuwait, the fourth largest Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries producer, is happy with OPEC's decision to keep production unchanged and ruled out any output cut when the organisation meets again in September. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	4	754	882	Asked about the recent increase in oil prices, Sheikh Ahmad said: "The market is reacting to sentiment rather than fundamentals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	5	883	935	There is a lot of supply but the prices are rising." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	6	945	1035	The minister expects prices to increase to around 70 dollars a barrel as winter appoaches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	7	1036	1100	"We are approaching winter and definitely demand will increase." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	8	1110	1214	Last July oil prices surged above 147 dollars a barrel before plunging to barely 32 dollars in December. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	9	1224	1384	Continuing their recent recovery, prices shot back above 66 dollars a barrel on Friday on further signs of economic recovery and a weakening of the US currency.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	1	189	370	Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two main Palestinian factions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	2	380	589	The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	3	599	796	The firefight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank, who was also on Israel's wanted list. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	4	806	994	Samman barricaded himself into a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas militant, police and Hamas said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	5	1004	1092	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	6	1093	1190	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	7	1200	1335	Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	8	1345	1490	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	9	1500	1682	"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a news conference in Gaza. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	10	1692	1933	The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	11	1943	2154	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	12	2164	2331	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	13	2341	2442	A senior official from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas accusations as "lies." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	14	2452	2662	"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	15	2672	2761	A spokesman for Palestinian security forces, Adnan Damiri, defended the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	16	2771	2838	"We in the Palestinian security branches are not a political force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	17	2839	2855	We are security. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	18	2856	2933	We will not allow any Palestinian party to have guns and threaten civilians." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	19	2943	3121	Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the Palestinian security branches." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	20	3131	3192	"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	21	3193	3275	"It was an attempt to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	22	3285	3452	Abbas's power base has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas ousted his Fatah party from the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling Israeli blockade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	23	3462	3657	The rival factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail, and each side frequently accuses the other of launching campaigns of persecution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	24	3667	3969	Palestinians are pessimistic about the two sides reconciling, with 51 percent saying that unity between Gaza and the West Bank will happen only after a long time and 27 percent saying the split is permanent, said a poll released on Sunday by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PSR). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	25	3979	4157	Rights group Amnesty International has lambasted both Hamas and Fatah for arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in their respective areas of control. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	26	4167	4319	On May 20 the Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet that includes members of Fatah but not Hamas, further widening the sectarian rift.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	5	717	841	The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and the Australian embassy has been informed about the incident, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	6	851	973	Police said the man had been staying in the guest house since May 29 and had arrived in India on May 16 on a tourist visa.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	1	175	320	AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo Maldini a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	2	330	570	The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	3	580	748	Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home win over Lazio. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	4	758	960	But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti made what will likely be a more discreet departure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	5	970	1097	He too is likely to leave Milan to join Chelsea next season, despite Milan's fans chanting for him to stay throughout the game.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	7	1313	1457	Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	9	1629	1746	On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the post with the outside of his right boot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	10	1756	1972	But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	11	1982	2118	Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	13	1852	1899	As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	16	2188	2306	The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season to recover in time for the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	17	2316	2420	But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best tennis of his 10-year career.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	1	186	386	A Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody crackdown on pro- democracy protests in Beijing 20 years ago has been refused entry to the city, an official and a legislator said Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	8	1546	1747	He says the only reason he was given for being denied entry to Hong Kong -- although his two sons and a filmmaker with him were allowed into the former British colony -- was "questions of immigration". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	9	1757	1923	"This denying me entry without valid reasons shows that Hong Kong, which has a particular status within China and larger freedom, obeys orders from Beijing," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0193	1	179	353	The Kuwaiti emir opened on Sunday the new parliament, calling on lawmakers to end political turmoil that has rocked the oil-rich Gulf state and focus on economic development.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	1	180	290	Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock which towers over London, marked its 150th anniversary Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	2	300	456	The clock started ticking on May 31 1859 and has continued with only occasional interruptions for maintenance, bad weather and even bird strikes ever since. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	3	466	640	The clock, housed in St Stephen's Tower which adjoins Britain's House of Commons, is one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions and boasts some amazing statistics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	4	650	805	Each of the four Gothic clock faces is seven metres wide, with a minute hand over four metres long which travels the equivalent of 190 kilometres per year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	5	815	975	A Latin inscription is carved beneath each one -- "Domine salvam fac Reginam nostrum Victoriam primam" which means: "O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	6	976	1032	Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain at the time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	7	1042	1231	The 96 metre-high tower which houses the clock was built as part of the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin following a major fire in 1843. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	8	1241	1355	A competition was opened in 1846 to decide who should build the clock, but it took seven years to decide a winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	9	1365	1570	Eventually, the winner was named as Edward Dent, who had already made a chronometer for the HMS Beagle, the ship which carried Charles Darwin on a worldwide voyage which led him to the theory of evolution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	10	1580	1720	The clock cost 2,500 pounds to build and was completed in 1854 but it was not installed until the clock tower was finished five years later.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	14	2182	2366	It is not entirely clear where the name Big Ben comes from -- some say refers to Sir Benjamin Hall, an MP at the time, while others claim it was after heavyweight boxer Benjamin Caunt.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	2	391	622	Companies chosen by the regional government will pump oil from two Kurdish fields via an Iraqi pipeline to Turkey with the consent of Baghdad in a step that could pave the way to ending bitter domestic feuds over Iraq's oil wealth.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	4	825	1059	"Piping of the oil will start Monday morning from the Taq Taq field, pumping it from seven wells," said Mohammed Okotan, director of the Taq Taq project for Turkey's Genel Enerji, which is partnered with Calgary-based Addax Petroleum.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	27	3760	3951	But as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	28	3961	4150	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not mend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	29	4160	4333	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	30	4343	4454	Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a move followed only by Nicaragua.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	1	193	382	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	2	392	612	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were pursuing the leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	3	622	769	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	4	779	869	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	5	879	1022	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	6	1032	1165	However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was impossible to estimate when the offensive would end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	7	1175	1281	"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot give any timeframe," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	8	1291	1497	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	9	1507	1737	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	10	1747	1862	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	11	1863	1967	The attack was repulsed successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	12	1977	2202	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere, in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10, insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	13	2212	2440	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	14	2450	2585	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	15	2595	2812	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	16	2822	2975	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	17	2976	3039	We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	18	3049	3242	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	19	3252	3349	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	20	3350	3474	The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	21	3484	3599	As the government steps up its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	22	3609	3807	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	23	3817	4020	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	24	4030	4251	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	25	4261	4364	Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the situation in Swat Valley. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	26	4374	4546	"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organization's delegation in Pakistan, in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	27	4556	4736	Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local policeman Shoukat Hussain said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	28	4746	4864	And in North Waziristan, suspected militants killed a former government doctor and an Afghan national, officials said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	1	198	382	More than 100 people rallied in Singapore late Sunday as part of a regional effort by civil rights groups to press Myanmar's military rulers to release democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	2	392	607	The yellow-clad demonstrators observed a minute of silence and released yellow balloons bearing good wishes for the pro-democracy leader during their gathering at a park designated as Singapore's free-speech corner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	3	617	743	Similar rallies were also held simultaneously in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, organisers said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	4	753	938	Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her crumbling lakeside mansion after the junta refused to honour elections won by her political party in 1990. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	5	948	1218	The Nobel Peace Prize winner was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison and charged on May 14 for allegedly breaching the terms of her house arrest after John Yettaw, 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, swam to her home and stayed there for two nights. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	6	1228	1428	On Sunday, Myanmar's deputy defence minister Major General Aye Myint told a regional security forum in Singapore that Aung San Suu Kyi had "covered up" the truth by failing to report Yettaw’s visit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	7	1438	1528	Braema Mathi, one of the organisers of the rally, slammed the Myanmar official's comments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	8	1538	1622	"It’s devastating that they are alluding to this collusion between her and Yettaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	9	1623	1687	They need to look at their own security lapses," Mathi told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	10	1697	1918	"It is my hope that this event will be the beginning of concerted efforts by the people of ASEAN to write to their governments and lobby for her release," she said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	11	1928	2068	Wunna, a Myanmar citizen working in Singapore, said the Myanmar junta was "trying to find an excuse" to continue detaining Aung San Suu Kyi.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	13	2129	2273	It is a sham," said Wunna, who was at the demonstration but would not give her full name because of fear of reprisals by the Myanmar government.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	1	174	372	Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze of all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that have raised tensions between the key allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	2	382	621	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	3	631	842	The premier also held firm on Israel's controversial blockade of Hamas-run Gaza Strip, warning that the Islamists were rearming and that the ceasefire that ended a 22-day war on January 18 remained very fragile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	4	852	1079	Netanyahu did not himself address the settlements issue during the weekly cabinet meeting, but Katz's fighting words were echoed by other members of the largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party, Labour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	5	1089	1316	A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	6	1326	1454	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	7	1455	1520	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	8	1530	1578	"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	9	1579	1727	They're not even ready to meet the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the Americans to do all the work," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	10	1737	1919	Abbas, who met Obama last week 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has vowed that that he will not resume talks unless Israel freezes settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	11	1929	2129	The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the settlements, including so-called natural growth construction that allows for building to accommodate a rising population. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	12	2139	2368	The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells that the new US president could put pressure on Israel as part of his new approach to the Muslim world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	13	2378	2529	"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not accept," said Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	14	2539	2818	Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party, the most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is black and white or write or wrong is wrong." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	15	2828	2946	More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	16	2956	3154	Although the international community considers all settlements to be illegal, Israel makes a distinction between those built with the state's blessing and outposts constructed without authorisation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	17	3164	3285	Netanyahu has said he would dismantle outposts, but that it made "no sense" to ask for a complete freeze of construction. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	18	3295	3448	Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	19	3449	3504	Bush sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	20	3514	3697	Bush said that given the existence of major settlement blocs in the West Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part of a final peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	21	3707	3945	Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and Israel over creating a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was committed to the principle and Netanyahu so far refusing to endorse it in public. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	22	3955	4122	Obama is due in Saudi Arabia and Egypt this week in a bid to reach out to Muslims and end the deep mistrust of the United States felt across much of the Islamic world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	23	4132	4308	Netanyahu on Sunday also held firm on maintaining the blockade of Gaza, saying that "we do not want to strengthen Hamas" by allowing the Islamist group to rebuild its defences. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	0	58	87	Israeli FM to Russia, Belarus 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	1	164	347	Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman leaves for his first official visits to Russia and Belarus on Monday to discuss Iran and bilateral issues, his ministry said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	2	357	551	In Moscow, Lieberman, a Russian-speaking Soviet emigrant, will meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, counterpart Sergei Lavrov and heads of the Jewish community. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	3	561	689	He will discuss "political developments and regional threats with his hosts" as well as bilateral relations, said the statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	4	699	860	Topping the agenda for the visit is the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear programme, a "severe geopolitical threat to Israel and the entire region," it said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	5	870	1097	Russia is helping build the first nuclear reactor in the Islamic Republic, which Israel considers its arch-enemy after repeated statements by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for the Jewish state to be "wiped off the map." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	6	1107	1359	Widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear power, Israel along with main ally Washington suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	7	1369	1596	Moscow is seeking a greater role in the Middle East and a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday that Russia hopes Lieberman's visit will boost the country's hopes of hosting a Middle East peace conference this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	8	1606	1727	The statement from Lieberman's ministry made no mention of the conference idea but Israel has so far been unenthusiastic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	9	1737	1906	Israel is unhappy about Russia's contacts with the Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip, an Iranian-backed group pledged to the destruction of the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	10	1916	2130	Russia is the only member of the Quartet -- the European Union, the United Nations and the United States -- to be formally on speaking terms with Hamas, classified as a terrorist group by the EU, Israel and the US. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	11	2140	2364	During his trip to Damascus a week ago, Lavrov met with Hamas supremo Khaled Meshaal, telling the Vesti-24 channel later that "we felt a more realistic assessment of the situation" following the talks with the exiled leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	12	2374	2590	Lavrov also reiterated that Moscow wanted to see Israel lift a blockade it slapped on Gaza after Hamas assumed power there in June 2007, saying "we hope that we can push toward its removal in the foreseeable future." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	13	2600	2681	At the time, Israel said it was said it was "deeply disappointed" by the meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	14	2691	2862	Following his stay in Russia, Lieberman will travel to Belarus where he will meet President Alexander Lukashenko and Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on Thursday in Minsk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	15	2872	3072	It will mark Lieberman's first trip to Russia or Belarus since he was sworn in as foreign minister along with the rest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's largely right-wing government on March 31.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	1	194	391	Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final on Sunday where he will face big-hitting Fernando Gonazalez who almost missed Roland Garros due to freak injury caused by signing autographs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	2	401	567	Third seed Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the last eight here with a convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	3	577	860	The ever-improving 22-year-old, with former two-time Roland Garros finalist Alex Corretja helping hone his claycourt game, looked in impressive physical condition with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	4	870	1038	Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of any player in the last 16, was wilting by the time he slipped 0-3 down in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	5	1048	1181	He needed treatment on his left leg after falling awkwardly before Murray went on to secure a convincing victory in the seventh game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	6	1191	1300	Chilean 13th seed Gonzalez revealed how an injury signing autographs almost shattered his French Open dreams. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	7	1310	1536	The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	8	1546	1593	As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	9	1603	1748	"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	10	1758	1872	"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room because my ankle was so painful."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0210	13	1822	2044	However, violence has dropped sharply since India and Pakistan started a peace process in January 2004 to resolve pending disputes, including Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries but claimed in full by both.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	1	194	388	Cuba has agreed to resume talks with the United States on migration and direct mail, a US official said here Sunday, as tense ties continue to thaw under President Barack Obama's administration. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	2	398	654	The announcement came as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepared to travel to the Organization of American States general assembly in Honduras, where Washington and its southern neighbors are caught in a row over the pace of normalization with Cuba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	3	664	766	The Cuban government informed Washington on Saturday that it "would like to resume migration talks.... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	4	767	896	(and) engage in talks on direct mail service," the senior State Department official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	5	906	979	But he said the two governments still have to decide on a time and place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	6	989	1208	US officials said May 23 that the Obama administration had proposed to resume the discussions on the thorny issue, which had been conducted every two years until they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	8	1224	1405	The official called the moves a "very positive development and step forward" as the Obama administration pursues engagement with Cuba, which has been under a decades-old US embargo. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	9	1415	1623	The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of additional dialogue," such as in the area of counternarcotics, counter terrorism, hurricane and disaster preparedness response.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	0	58	107	Tennis: Murray reaches French Open quarter-finals 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	1	180	355	Andy Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals of Roland Garros on Sunday with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	2	365	506	The third-seeded Briton will now tackle three-time quarter-finalist Fernando Gonzalez, the Chilean 12th seed, for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	3	516	733	Ever-improving Murray, 22, has now won four successive matches on clay for the first time in his career and he looked impressive on Sunday with his physical fitness proving crucial in a tie of long, punishing rallies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	4	743	968	He broke Cilic, whom he had beaten twice in their two previous meetings, in the opening game and although the tall Croatian hit back immediately, Murray nipped ahead again in the 11th game on his way to taking the opener 7-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	5	978	1105	Breaks were traded again in the seventh and eighth games of the second before Murray's greater experience told in the tiebreak. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	6	1115	1351	Murray was soon a break to the good in the third set against the 20-year-old Cilic, the youngest player left in the men's draw, whose miserable afternoon got worse when he needed treatment to his left leg at 0-3 after falling awkwardly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	7	1361	1516	The Scotsman, with a claycourt game honed by the help of former two-time French Open runner-up Alex Corretja, was soon 4-0 ahead over the wilting Croatian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	8	1526	1747	Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of any player in the last 16, pulled one break back, surrendered it to trail 1-5 before Murray secured a convincing victory in the seventh game.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	1	176	369	European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new political divisions across the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	2	379	622	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	3	632	855	The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	4	865	1030	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	5	1040	1228	First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next EU summit in June, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	6	1238	1361	"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	7	1371	1540	The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	8	1550	1596	"Europe must play a leading role in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	9	1597	1643	For that, it must have efficient institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	10	1644	1694	That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	11	1704	1803	Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	12	1804	1847	"To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	13	1848	1887	Unlimited enlargement is not possible." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	14	1897	2118	The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	15	2128	2261	In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	16	2262	2360	In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	17	2370	2494	In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	18	2495	2537	Portugal expects a record abstention rate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	19	2547	2767	The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	20	2777	2945	"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think- tank in London.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	2	368	542	The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	3	552	690	He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	4	700	834	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	5	844	1070	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	6	1080	1177	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to win by just over a second to Spaniard Lorenzo.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	8	1306	1503	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	9	1513	1624	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	10	1634	1741	However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was clearly fastest in the wet.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	12	1890	2039	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	13	2049	2226	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	14	2236	2442	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits, essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	1	181	383	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is looking forward to uniting all the talents at his disposal during the World Twenty20 in England after competing against his team-mates in the Indian Premier League. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	2	393	508	India are the defending World Twenty20 champions after winning the inaugural edition in South Africa two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	3	518	721	Since then the IPL, a lucrative franchise Twenty20 tournament that features the world's best players, has burst on the scene although this year it was played in South Africa because of security concerns. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	4	731	890	"Of course it is a pleasure representing your country after the IPL where you have limited talent in your side," Dhoni told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	5	900	1025	"But here we have plenty of options and we have the cream of the IPL so there is less pressure on each and every individual." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	6	1035	1201	India supply more IPL players than any other nation but wicket-keeper batsman Dhoni, the captain of the Chennai Super Kings, said this was not an advantage in itself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	7	1211	1249	"The IPL will help us but not only us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	8	1250	1340	There are quite a few players from other countries but most of our players are in the IPL. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	9	1350	1515	"The best thing is that our youngsters will know how to handle pressure, when in the last over you need 10 or 15 runs, everyone in our side has faced that situation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	10	1525	1610	"It's good exposure for our guys to play against guys like Brett Lee and Shane Warne.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	12	1850	1968	"In Twenty20, there is  no such thing as a weak side, an individual can take the game away from you," Dhoni explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	13	1969	2043	"If we take care of the immediate steps, the result takes care of itself." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	14	2053	2294	Reflecting on India's success in South Africa, where they beat arch-rivals Pakistan in a thrilling final, Dhoni said: "We can't live on or relish the memories, we have to turn up and do everything from scratch again, it's not about the past. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	15	2304	2396	"Cricket is a very cruel game, the moment you relax is when you are in trouble," Dhoni said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	16	2406	2486	Asked how the team had developed, Dhoni joked: "I've got quite a few grey hairs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	17	2487	2595	That's one change, the plus point is that in the last three years there have been fewer changes in the side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	18	2605	2696	"The individuals involved have played 80 to 90 one-day internationals, helps me personally.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	23	2994	3159	'The Little Master' has opted out of international Twenty20s and Dhoni said: "He's among the greatest, it's tough, you always want a player like Sachin in your side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	24	3169	3233	"But he wasn't at the last T20, the guys are getting used to it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	25	3234	3319	But he has a big impact in the dressing room, the amount of ideas he has is amazing." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	26	3329	3522	Much has been made of the impact various strategies might have on the outcome of Twenty20 matches but Dhoni said: "It's about how quickly the individual adapts, about what he does on the field. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0235	27	3532	3641	"It's not only about strategies but how you implement and how the individual you are planning against reacts.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0245	4	674	796	"In the same period, 17 brave service members have been martyred and 57 have been wounded, and four are missing," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0245	5	806	935	The operations were in the Helmand, Uruzgan, Ghazni, Farah and Paktika provinces, all areas which have a heavy Taliban influence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0245	6	945	1170	"We are trying to use the available capacities of the national forces and NATO and coalition forces, and the troops that will be deployed in the future, to create an atmosphere where our people could vote freely," Azimi said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	1	199	334	Big-hitting Chilean Fernando Gonzalez revealed on Sunday how a freak injury signing autographs almost shattered his French Open dreams. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	2	344	578	The 28-year-old Chilean, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	3	588	635	As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	4	645	790	"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	5	800	914	"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room because my ankle was so painful." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	6	924	1042	The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season to recover in time for the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	7	1052	1156	But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best tennis of his 10-year career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	8	1166	1346	"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi- finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely finished off by his injury. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	9	1356	1409	"I have played at a good level almost in every match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	10	1410	1538	I enjoy going onto the courts and into practice although as I am getting older I tend to practice less but with more intensity." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	11	1548	1700	The 12th seeded Gonzalez will now tackle either British third seed Andy Murray or Marin Cilic, the 13th seeded Croatian, for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	12	1710	1756	Gonzalez simply overpowered 30th seed Hanescu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	13	1766	2001	The result was never in doubt from the time the Chilean, who lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero in the 2003 quarter-finals and Roger Federer at the same stage last year, broke twice in the first four games of the first set to take a 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	14	2011	2176	With his trademark, booming forehand forcing the beanpole Romanian to scamper haplessly from side to side, the Chilean wrapped up the opening set in just 25 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	15	2186	2413	A break in the ninth game was enough to decide the second set, as the rallies remained fierce and short, while another break of the dispirited and one- dimensional Hanescu in the first game of the third set Gonzalez on his way. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	16	2423	2592	Gonzalez, whose best Grand Slam performance remains his runner-up spot to Federer at the 2007 Australian Open, broke through again in the seventh game to stretch to 5-2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	17	2602	2730	The 1998 Roland Garros junior champion then wrapped up the tie with his 50th winner to finish off Hanescu after only 87 minutes.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	1	178	350	Germany have tentatively organised friendly internationals with Chile and Egypt on November 14 and 18, general manager Oliver Bierhoff told the SID sports agency on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	2	360	475	The matches are dependent on Germany landing first place in their World Cup qualifying Group 4, Bierhoff explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	3	485	676	Currently, they lead Russia by four points with five wins and a draw in six matches, but the latter have a game in hand, while Finland are well adrift in third place five points further back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	4	686	887	Three-time winners Germany are already well advanced with preparations for the finals and intend to have three friendlies in Africa before heading for the finals in South Africa, assuming they qualify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	5	897	998	The Germans are tipped to set up their headquarters in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	6	1008	1239	"Everyone is talking of Cape Town and its region but we would have optimum facilities in Gauteng - winter is drier there, altitude is 1600 metres and that's important as most matches will be played at that altitude," said Bierhoff.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	1	180	346	Fifteen Indonesians were killed Sunday when an inter-city bus lost control due to a brake failure on Sumatra island, police said, adding that the death toll may rise. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	2	356	500	The bus was carrying 37 people when it tried to overtake two cars in front of it on a narrow ascending road, police official Ardiyanto told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	3	510	613	One of the cars stopped abruptly and the bus, due to a brake failure, slid down into a ravine, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	4	623	845	"The number of casualties may rise as there are ten passengers that are badly injured," he said, adding that the accident took place at 2pm (0700GMT) in the Lembah Anai area of Padang Panjang city in West Sumatra province.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	1	174	333	The Israeli cabinet on Sunday softened a much-criticized bill on the Naqba, what many Palestinians lament as the  "catastrophe" of the 1948 creation of Israel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	2	343	519	The revised draft law now prohibits any government funds from being used for events marking the Naqba, instead of banning commemorations altogether, a government official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	3	529	654	"The original bill marked a serious infringement on the freedom of expression, which we deemed excessive," the official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	4	664	858	The changes followed a legal review of the bill approved by the cabinet last week, which would have prohibited any events marking Naqba and provided for penalties of up to three years in prison. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	5	868	1051	In the week following the bill's submission by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, the draft was attacked by both Arab MPs and rights groups. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	6	1061	1126	The bill must still pass three votes by parliament to become law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	7	1136	1329	A government committee also on Sunday scrapped another Yisrael Beitenu draft law, which would have required Israelis to take an oath of loyalty and which mainly targeted Israel's Arab minority. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	8	1339	1547	Israeli Arabs and the extent of their loyalty to the Jewish state was the top campaign theme of the secular Yisrael Beitenu, which came in third in the February election, winning 15 of parliament's 120 seats.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0250	2	273	501	Russian international midfielder Yevgeny Aldonin was the hero, scoring the only goal of the match with a 22-metre screamer in the third minute of injury time for the Red Army side's fifth national cup win in the post-Soviet era.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	1	185	377	Taiwan's pro-independence opposition on Sunday renewed its pledge to hold a referendum aimed at stopping the Beijing-friendly administration from signing a comprehensive trade pact with China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	2	387	611	The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said it hopes to collect at least 80,000 signatures before the end of August in the first part of a two-step process required by law for the campaign, announced last month, to go ahead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	3	621	775	Once it reaches its target figure, the party will then have to enlist the endorsements of up to one million supporters before a referendum can take place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	4	785	920	"Concerns are mounting about signing an ECFA (Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement) with China as it is not a pure trade agreement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	5	921	1005	Rather it has something to do with sovereignty," DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	6	1015	1138	"People here are entitled to decide if Taiwan people, through a referendum, approve such an agreement with China," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	7	1148	1363	The Ma Ying-jeou administration is targeting the pact -- similar in scope to a free trade agreement -- with Beijing to boost the flow of goods and personnel across the Strait and to help the island tackle recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	8	1373	1554	Chinese President Hu Jintao told visiting Wu Poh-hsiung, chairman of the Kuomintang, in Beijing last week that talks on the ECFA were likely to start in the second half of the year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	9	1564	1745	Hu said the mainland would like to see an economic agreement that will benefit economic development on both sides and improve people's welfare,  according to the Xinhua news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	10	1755	1936	Taiwan's Economic Minister Yiin Chii-ming had defended the trade pact, claiming that the island's economy could rise by 1.4 percentage points by forging an economic pact with China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	11	1946	2089	In particular, the petrochemical sector, machinery and auto components makers are expected to benefit from closer cross-strait ties, Yiin said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	12	2099	2249	But the DPP has strongly opposed the potential pact, which it claims would demote Taipei to the status of local government in any rapprochement talks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	13	2259	2447	China still regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification by force if necessary, although the two sides have been governed separately since the end of a civil war in 1949.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	2	395	532	"There is much to do at Dusseldorf, the club should be in the top flight and that has to be the goal," Matthaus, 48, told Bild newspaper. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	3	542	732	Dusseldorf have a long history and were champions in 1933 while they have also won the German Cup twice - but they have just been promoted to the second division after a decade in the third. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	4	742	942	Businessman Daniel Jammer, who already owns Maccabi Netanya and is close to Matthaus, is reputedly interested in investing in the outfit and told Bild he saw Matthaus in the role of sporting director. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	5	952	1031	Matthaus described the possibility as potentially "a very interesting mission." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	6	1041	1235	To date, Matthaus, who won a host of honours with Bayern Munich and led Germany to the 1990 World Cup, has coached in several countries but has yet really to make a name for himself in the role.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	1	179	351	Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia underlined her growing potential on Sunday by brushing aside Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	2	361	501	It is the first time that the 20-year-old from Bratislava has made it through to the last eight of a Grand Slam event at her eighth attempt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	3	511	627	"It was difficult because we were both nervous at the beginning and it was a case of not making mistakes," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	4	637	701	"But I prepared well for this game and knew how she would play." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	5	711	944	One of the smallest players on the WTA circuit at just 1.61 metres, Cibulkova had failed to take a set of Szavay in their three previous encounters, but she was quickly out of the blocks this time breaking serve twice for a 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	6	954	1136	Szavay, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	7	1146	1321	It was a different story at the start of the second half with Cibulkova tightening up and dropping serve to go 0-2 down, but she snatched one back in the next to level at 2-2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	8	1331	1540	The 20th seed then broke again in the fifth game keeping up a steady stream of baseline groundstrokes and allowing Szavay to make the errors as she sought a solution to her opponent's dominance of the rallies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	9	1550	1673	There looked to be no way back for the demoralised Hungarian as Cibulkova got to match point on her own serve at 5-2 ahead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	10	1683	1819	But a wild forehand let that slip away and she followed up with a double fault at break point to hand her opponent an unlikely lifeline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	11	1829	2087	Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of Russia or Li Na of China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	12	2097	2154	"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	1	176	331	Top seed Dinara Safina eased into the French Open quarter-finals on Sunday defeating Aravane Rezai of France 6-1, 6-0 in a 53-minute centre-court mismatch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	2	341	481	It was the Russian's 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	3	491	688	Rezai, playing for just the second time in the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament, started as a rank outsider, but she had the first glimpse of an opening with a break point in the third game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	4	698	846	Safina though comfortably brushed that aside and then, helped by two double faults from her opponent, broke serve in the following game to lead 3-1. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	5	856	1050	Safina, whose four games lost in her first three matches are the third least in all Grand Slams, then stepped on the accelerator to also take the next three games and the set in just 30 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	6	1060	1226	It was more of the same in the second set as Rezai seemed to be stage-struck on the Philippe Chatrier centre court against her much bigger and more physical opponent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	7	1236	1369	Safina bagged an early break of serve and jumped out into a 4-0 lead from which there was no way back for the struggling Frenchwoman.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	1	193	381	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	2	391	619	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	3	629	776	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	4	786	876	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	5	886	1029	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	6	1039	1245	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	7	1255	1485	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	8	1495	1610	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	10	1725	1948	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	11	1958	2186	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	12	2196	2329	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	13	2339	2556	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	14	2566	2782	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	15	2792	2985	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	19	3382	3492	As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	20	3502	3700	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	21	3710	3921	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five- million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	22	3931	4076	Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	23	4086	4307	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	24	4317	4497	Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local policeman Shoukat Hussain said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	1	192	373	Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two main Palestinian factions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	2	383	592	The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	3	602	801	The gunfight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank who was also on Israel's wanted list. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	4	811	997	Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas militant, police and Hamas said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	5	1007	1095	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	6	1096	1193	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	7	1203	1338	Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	8	1348	1493	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	9	1503	1686	"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a press conference in Gaza. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	10	1696	1937	The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	11	1947	2158	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	12	2168	2335	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	13	2345	2446	A senior official from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas accusations as "lies." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	14	2456	2666	"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	15	2676	2765	A spokesman for Palestinian security forces, Adnan Damiri, defended the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	16	2775	2842	"We in the Palestinian security branches are not a political force.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	19	2947	3125	Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the Palestinian security branches." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	20	3135	3196	"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	21	3197	3279	"It was an attempt to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	22	3289	3459	Abbas's power based has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas booted his Fatah party out of the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling Israeli blockade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	23	3469	3663	The two factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals of campaigns of persecution.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	2	398	613	Organisers said around 5,000 people rallied through the streets of the city to mark the anniversary of the military crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead following weeks of protests in the capital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	3	623	759	Among the marchers was Xiong Yan, a leading student activist during the 1989 demonstrations who now lives in exile in the United States.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	5	834	1015	Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong and one of the organisers of the annual march, said it was crucial that the city continued to mark the events of 20 years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	6	1025	1106	"We are the only place on Chinese soil that can commemorate June 4," he told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	7	1116	1278	"Hong Kong has become the conscience of China to remember... the crime of the Tiananmen Square massacre and push the regime (in Beijing) to admit their mistakes." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	8	1288	1354	The attendance at the march was sharply up on last year's figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	9	1355	1434	An annual candlelit vigil on Thursday is expected to attract tens of thousands.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	11	1658	1755	His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism of the crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	12	1765	1944	Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry to Hong Kong in the past, although it has a separate legal and immigration system from the mainland, including the right to protest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	13	1954	2118	"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	14	2128	2213	"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	15	2223	2425	The marchers gathered in the city's Victoria Park, waving banners with slogans such as "Pass the torch on, relay the message of democracy to those who come after us" and "Speak the truth, never forget." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	16	2435	2628	The rally included a small group of mainland Chinese students, who wore T-shirts citing former Communist leader Mao Zedong: "Whoever suppresses student movements is going to have a bad ending." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	17	2638	2778	"I am very excited to see so many people, as this is forbidden on the mainland," said one of the students, 20, who did not want to be named.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	1	176	338	Controversial NATO military exercises in former Soviet republic Georgia were nearing their end Sunday after provoking a furious reaction from neighbouring Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	2	348	488	The month-long drills involving about 1,100 troops from 10 NATO countries and six of the alliance's partner countries were to end on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	3	498	735	Russia, which fought a brief war with Georgia in August over the rebel South Ossetia region, denounced the exercises as "provocative" and announced plans to step up its own military training exercises near the Georgian border next month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	4	745	916	Analysts say that although they were planned before last year's war, the exercises have boosted Georgia's hopes of building closer ties with the Western military alliance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	5	926	1076	"They prove that the West, and NATO in particular, has not lost interest in Georgia after the August war," political analyst Soso Tsintsadze told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	7	1227	1339	The manoeuvres were aimed at improving the way nations operate together in crisis situations under a UN mandate.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	9	1416	1521	The first -- "Cooperative Longbow" -- was a "command post" exercise done almost exclusively on computers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	10	1522	1712	The second -- "Cooperative Lancer" -- which started on May 18 and ends Monday, is a field exercise involving around 400 troops and is designed to provide training on peacekeeping operations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	11	1722	1860	Russian leaders denounced the drills, with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling them "a step backwards" in resetting Russia-US relations.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0268	13	2072	2238	The exercises were held amid political uncertainty in Georgia as opposition supporters have protested for weeks to demand President Mikheil Saakashvili's resignation.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0276	4	664	908	Sunday's result was never in doubt from the time Gonzalez, who lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero in the 2003 quarter-finals and Roger Federer at the same stage last year, broke twice in the first four games of the first set to race out to a 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0276	5	918	1083	With his trademark, booming forehand forcing the beanpole Romanian to scamper haplessly from side to side, the Chilean wrapped up the opening set in just 25 minutes.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	2	361	501	It is the first time that the 20-year-old from Bratislava has made it through to the last eight of a Grand Slam event at her eighth attempt.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	4	754	936	Szavay, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	7	1350	1473	There looked to be no way back for the demoralised Hungarian as Cibulkova got to match point on her own serve at 5-2 ahead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	8	1483	1619	But a wild forehand let that slip away and she followed up with a double fault at break point to hand her opponent an unlikely lifeline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	9	1629	1887	Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of Russia or Li Na of China.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	8	1308	1428	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	9	1438	1605	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	10	1615	1736	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	11	1746	1883	Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	12	1893	2018	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	13	2028	2190	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	14	2200	2355	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	15	2365	2552	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	16	2562	2638	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	17	2639	2686	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	18	2696	2896	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	19	2906	3075	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	20	3085	3279	The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this summer, The Detroit Free Press reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	21	3289	3383	Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the newspaper report. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	22	3384	3453	This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be running. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	23	3463	3636	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	24	3646	3796	The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government, amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	25	3806	3891	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	26	3901	4148	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	27	4158	4272	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	28	4282	4409	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	29	4419	4503	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	30	4504	4651	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	31	4661	4873	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	32	4883	4967	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	33	4968	5047	Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by June 15. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	0	58	103	Turks suspicious of West, radical Islam: poll 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	1	177	346	Turks covet religion and are deeply suspicious of the West, but believe radical Islam poses threats to their country and the world, according to a poll published Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	2	356	544	An overwhelming majority of poll respondents -- 76 and 86 percent respectively -- believe the European Union and the United States aim to divide their country, Milliyet newspaper reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	3	554	644	Turkey is seeking to join the EU and the United States is among the country's NATO allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	4	654	875	The survey, conducted by Istanbul's Bahcesehir University among 1,715 people in April and May, found that 62 percent see religion as their top value, followed by secularism and democracy at 16 and 13 percent respectively. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	5	885	1078	Sixty-two percent said it was appropriate for Muslim women to cover their heads outside home, while 58 percent considered it a "sin" for women to wear bathsuits at the beach, Milliyet reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	6	1088	1170	Seventy-two percent said they would not wish to have alcohol-consuming neighbours. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	7	1180	1335	Some 66 percent said they would not welcome non-religious neighbours and 67 percent said the same for unmarried couples living together, Milliyet reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	8	1345	1527	The poll found that 64 percent do not wish to live next door to a Jew, 52 percent to a Christian, 42 percent to an American and 26 percent to anyone of a different ethnicity or race. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	9	1537	1660	But despite their conservative inclinations, the majority also expressed fears over radical Islam and attacks on democracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	10	1670	1836	Sixty-nine percent said extremist Islamist movements pose either a "great" or a "certain" threat to Turkey, and a slightly smaller majority believed so for the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0292	11	1846	1931	About 80 percent said "anti-democratic actions and thoughts" are a threat for Turkey. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	0	58	113	Football: Bordeaux's champion vintage ripens with Blanc 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	1	186	329	Bordeaux, which produces an estimated 700 million bottles of wine each year, may be best known in gastronomic circles for its distinct clarets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	2	339	410	But in the world of French football this year's top vintage is a Blanc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	3	420	541	In leading Bordeaux to the French league title for the first time in a decade Laurent Blanc has pulled off a double coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	4	551	741	Not only has he taken the Girondins to glory in only his second season as a coach but the 43-year-old from Ales has also managed to cure a bout of nationwide yawning stretching back to 2002. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	5	751	874	That year, Lyon won their first ever league title after some near misses and romped past all-comers for the next six years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	6	884	1140	But this year was no one horse race, with Blanc's men landing the crown after a final-day win over relegated Caen gave them 80 points from 38 matches to 77 for Marseille and 71 for Lyon, who next season will have to play in the Champions League qualifiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	7	1150	1301	"I am really delighted," said Blanc, who pinpointed the win over Lyon five weeks ago as the moment he felt his men were destined to end up as top dogs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	8	1311	1406	"Last year we lost both matches to Lyon, our direct rivals, even if maybe we didn't deserve to. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	9	1407	1560	Then, when Marseille lost to Lyon, that opened the way up for us," noted Blanc, a mainstay of the French side which won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	10	1570	1723	Blanc, who suggested it would be very difficult to replicate Lyon's long run of titles, said rigorous hard work in training over the winter had been key. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	11	1733	1782	"We really put in some physical grind in January. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	12	1783	1920	What also helped was that we only really realised quite late in the day just what a great run we were on, so we were under less pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	13	1921	2045	And mentally we were very strong - several times we turned things around right at the death when things weren't going well." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	14	2055	2253	Two defeats in their first four games saw Bordeaux make not the brightest of starts and by the end of September they had eight points to make up on Lyon, who retained the margin going into December. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	15	2263	2441	A pre-Christmas purple patch saw Bordeaux close to within three points but draws against struggling Grenoble and Saint Etienne held up progress as Marseille soared into top spot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	16	2451	2664	By April, Lyon were fading, their confidence dented by yet another failure to impress in Europe as Barcelona dumped them easily in the Champions League second phase, leaving Bordeaux and Marseille to scrap it out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	17	2674	2930	Lyon then ultimately did Bordeaux a decisive favour with a May 17 win at Marseille's seething Stade Velodrome to prepare the coronation which came with Saturday's denouement, Yoan Gouffran securing the title after a club record 11th consecutive league win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	18	2940	3177	Gilding Bordeaux's lily was a League Cup win in April while a further bonus was last week's signing up of star playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, who had only been on loan from AC Milan and who has been the French league's shining star this term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	19	3187	3328	But now they will be judged on whether they can do what Lyon have consistently failed to do - make a good impression in the Champions League. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	20	3338	3468	Lyon have never made it past the quarter-finals while 1993 winners Marseille remain the only French side to lift the European Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	21	3478	3711	Despite his relative touchline inexperience going into that challenge, Blanc will take heart from the success of Barcelona's 38-year-old Pep Guardiola, who outfoxed Sir Alex Ferguson to land the trophy in his debut season as a coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	22	3721	3944	For Bordeaux, triumphing in Europe will demand a different, more elastic mentality from that which suffices for domestic fare and they will be only too aware the transition has traditionally proved awkward for French clubs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	23	3954	4084	That might be down to cultural issues for, as any Frenchman knows, the first course is normally washed down with a glass of rouge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	24	4094	4177	But with Blanc's coaching genius out of the bottle, Bordeaux are now eying dessert. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	25	4187	4364	That would normally mean sampling any one of a host of the south west's finest vins blancs - although lifting the Champions League would surely demand an 'upgrade' to champagne. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	0	58	117	Indian court rules schools can bar Sikhs who pluck eyebrows 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	1	194	360	An Indian court has upheld a decision by a religious body to deny a female student who plucked her eyebrows admission to a Sikh university, media reports said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	2	370	623	The ruling said faith-based educational institutions had the right to refuse admission to students who did not meet religious standards, as "maintaining hair unshorn is an essential component of the Sikh religion," according to the Press Trust of India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	3	633	812	The policy had been challenged by Gurleen Kaur after she was denied admission to the Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	4	822	952	Kaur was excluded on the grounds that she was not a "true Sikh as she was plucking her eyebrows," according to the Times of India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	5	962	1108	Sikhism requires men and women to keep their hair uncut at all times, and many men sport lengthy beards and wear turbans to cover their long hair. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	6	1118	1253	Kaur's petition was supported by male students who had also been refused admission to the university because they trimmed their beards. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	7	1263	1488	The Punjab and Haryana High Court, which jointly serves both states, said it was "perfectly legitimate" for Sikh organisations to refuse any benefit to members of the community who did not strictly adhere to religious tenets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	8	1498	1623	Avtar Singh Makkar, the head of the Sikh body which administers the college in Amritsar, said he was happy with the judgment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	9	1633	1752	"Our stand that unshorn hair is of paramount importance for Sikhs has been vindicated," the Times quoted him as saying. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	10	1762	1872	About 24 million people follow the Sikh faith in India, with a majority of them living in the state of Punjab.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	1	185	361	Sri Lanka on Sunday rejected growing calls to probe human rights violations amid allegations that thousands of civilians perished in the final battle against Tamil separatists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	2	371	593	Media Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said organisations calling for investigations had "ulterior motives," and dismissed demands for independent probes into the final phase of Sri Lanka's war against Tamil separatists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	3	603	740	"Those who give various civilian casualty figures and call for these probes must have ulterior motives," Abeywardena told reporters here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	4	750	857	He said the government itself was in the process of assessing the civilian casualties, but gave no figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	5	867	1052	"Our officials knew how many people were in the (war zone) area and we are taking a tally on the number of people now in the IDP (internally displaced persons) camps," Abeywardena said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	6	1062	1278	His remarks came a day after the London-based rights group, Amnesty International, called for an independent probe into the number of civilians killed while government forces crushed Tamil Tiger rebels two weeks ago.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	1	194	384	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces hunted down the militant leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	2	394	623	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	3	633	745	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," the secretary of defence said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	4	755	891	"Only five to ten percent job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	5	901	1107	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	6	1117	1335	Security officials also reported that 45 militants were killed in fierce fighting in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	7	1345	1542	Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	8	1552	1738	"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he announced the Mingora win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	9	1748	1947	Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	10	1957	2173	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	13	2623	2720	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	14	2730	2844	But as the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	15	2854	3052	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	17	3283	3429	Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" to revenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	18	3439	3601	In South Waziristan on Sunday, police official Syed Ahmad said that 45 militants and two soldiers were killed as security forces repulsed an attack on army posts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	19	3611	3823	Fears that the current army offensive could expand into Waziristan have already sent thousands of people there fleeing their homes, although the military have denied any movements in the tribal belt are imminent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	1	191	394	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a rumbling scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party ahead of European and local elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	2	404	607	He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I believe in" as well as promising that every lawmaker would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last four years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	3	617	767	A total of 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said they will stand down since the scandal broke over three weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	4	768	937	The Daily Telegraph newspaper has been publishing leaked documents detailing hundreds of claims from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	5	947	1166	On Sunday, the Telegraph published an ICM poll suggesting Labour would come third in the European elections, in which Britons vote Thursday, with just 17 percent, behind the second opposition centrist Liberal Democrats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	6	1176	1354	Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Labour has done in an opinion poll since 1987. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	7	1364	1489	But Brown dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader in an interview with BBC television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	8	1499	1532	"Things go up and down," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	9	1533	1618	"We're going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	10	1628	1812	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult for them in a difficult economic situation." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	11	1822	1949	Brown added: "I did not come into politics to allow a situation to develop where MPs ran away with money they did not deserve". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	12	1959	2174	He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, votes at 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber the House of Lords. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	13	2184	2334	Brown said he does "not accept the case for an unelected House of Lords", adding he was "always open" to arguments for reforming of the voting system. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	14	2344	2509	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in 2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among many.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	1	203	390	An outbreak of diarrhoea has spread across Bangladesh's south-west after a cyclone slammed into the south of the country and neighbouring India earlier in the week, officials said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	2	400	576	At least 237 people were killed after Cyclone Aila on Monday hit the low-lying coast north of the Bay of Bengal, where a military and civilian relief operation is now underway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	3	586	799	Doctors said diarrhoea had broken out at an "alarming rate" as inundation and waterlogging in a vast swathe of land close to the world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans has destroyed supplies of drinking water. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	4	809	1018	In the worst affected Koyra, Dakope and Khulna districts at least two people have died and over 5000 people treated for diarrhoea, half in the last 24 hours, regional medical chief Lutfur Rahman Khan told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	5	1028	1055	"The situation is alarming. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	6	1056	1136	So far we have more than 5000 people who are sick with diarrhoea in this region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	7	1137	1220	Another 3000 have been treated for water borne diseases like dysentery," Khan said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	8	1230	1385	Khan said breached levees and washed away embankments enabled tidal seawater to inundate the region, destroying almost all sources of fresh drinking water. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	9	1395	1430	"The crisis is worsening every day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	10	1431	1496	People are leaving their villages for cities and towns," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	11	1506	1731	In neighbouring Satkhira district doctors have treated over 2000 cases of diarrhoea since the cyclone hit, again with half the cases reported in the last 24 hours, head of the district medical service Mohammad Ibadullah said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	12	1741	1961	The government said it has dispatched nearly 900 medical teams to tackle the crisis but charities and local officials warned any improvement would depend on how soon the authorities can rebuild the destroyed embankments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	13	1971	2055	The army had brought in fresh water supplies but not enough for the cyclone victims. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	14	2065	2185	On Saturday Oxfam's Bangladesh operations chief Heather Blackwell called the situation "an emerging humanitarian crisis.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	1	177	301	Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	2	311	491	"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," ministry spokesman Nguyen Huy Nga told AFP, adding that the case was "confirmed officially by our ministry this morning." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	3	501	726	An initial test at the tropical diseases hospital in southern Ho Chi Minh City was positive, and two follow-up tests at the city's Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the Institute, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	4	736	824	The patient, a 23-year-old man, was in a stable condition with a slight fever, Tu added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	5	834	944	State television reported that the patient returned home early last week from the United States via Hong Kong. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	6	954	1037	The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been formally notified of the case. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	7	1047	1165	It said the patient sought medical attention after noticing flu symptoms a day after returning from the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	8	1166	1329	Five members of his family have been given medication and placed in isolation, while passengers on the same flight as the man are being tracked down, the WHO said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	9	1339	1486	Emergence of the virus in Vietnam was "highly likely" given the country's international travel links, Shelaye Boothey, a WHO spokeswoman, told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	1	176	369	European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new political divisions across the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	2	379	622	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	3	632	855	The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	4	865	1030	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	5	1040	1228	First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next EU summit in June, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	6	1238	1361	"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	7	1371	1540	The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	8	1550	1596	"Europe must play a leading role in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	9	1597	1643	For that, it must have efficient institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	10	1644	1694	That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	11	1704	1803	Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	12	1804	1847	"To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	13	1848	1887	Unlimited enlargement is not possible." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	14	1897	2118	The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	15	2128	2261	In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	16	2262	2360	In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	17	2370	2494	In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	18	2495	2537	Portugal expects a record abstention rate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	19	2547	2767	The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	20	2777	2945	"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think- tank in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	21	2955	3020	"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	22	3021	3102	The stakes can seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	23	3112	3314	But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in power, with far-right and left-wing parties expected to benefit from protest votes and low turnouts in some member states. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	24	3324	3591	In Britain, where euroscepticism runs deep, the governing Labour Party is expected to garner only 16 to 17 percent of the vote, putting it in third place against the rival Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, weekend polls in the Times and Sunday Telegraph suggested. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	25	3601	3896	The leader of the main opposition Conservatives, David Cameron, has opened up new divisions in Europe by saying he would withdraw his party from the main centre-right bloc in the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and join a new eurosceptic alliance with Czech and Polish parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	26	3906	4082	The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament, which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide range of issues. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	27	4092	4214	The parliament will also endorse the new president of the European Commission after a nomination is made by the EU summit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	28	4215	4327	Jose Manuel Barroso, the conservative former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a second term.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	1	187	347	Yuta Tabuse, the only Japanese ever to have played in the US National Basketball Association, is taking another shot at the world's premier stage for the sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	2	357	556	He has been invited to the NBA Dallas Mavericks' pre-summer mini-camp on June 11-12 and will skip the inaugural East Asian championships to be held in the central Japanese city of Komaki in mid-June. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	3	566	590	"I have nothing to lose. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	4	591	767	I want to face it with confidence," the 28-year-old, who briefly played with the Phoenix Suns as a point guard in the 2004-2005 season, told a news conference here on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	5	777	803	"I have no worries at all. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	6	804	842	I feel it is the time to fight again." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	7	852	1035	The mini-camp is an opportunity for aspiring players to vye for spots in NBA's summer league in July, another try-out before the clubs announce their final 12-man rosters in November. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	8	1045	1231	"I may have to overcome a few things in physical and other aspects but I believe my speed will be alright," he said, citing the need to work on one-on-one match- ups and shooting skills. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	9	1241	1332	Standing just 173 centimetres (5 feet 8 inches), Tabuse played in four games with the Suns.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	1	182	355	Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso has struggled with low approval ratings for many reasons and his smoking habit is one of them, a survey by a Tokyo civil group showed Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	2	365	578	Tokyo's Metropolitan Association on Smoking or Health released its annual survey on celebrities the public wants to see quit smoking to coincide with the World Health Organisation's World No Tobacco Day on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	3	588	646	Aso was ranked fourth in the survey, collecting 118 votes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	4	656	814	"Whenever I see the creased face and hear the hoarse voice, I cannot help thinking about grim future of Japan," read one comment on the association's website. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	5	824	972	The survey also named US President Barack Obama, ranked 11th, with another comment urging the two national leaders to "form a non-smoking alliance". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	6	982	1108	Oscar-winning Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, whose pictures have earned many fans, many of whom are children, ranked third. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0311	7	1118	1328	The first and second places were given to Japanese household names, one comic story-teller who hosts an educational health programme and a member of pop-group SMAP (Sports Music Assemble People), Takuya Kimura.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	1	180	380	The Niger president's dismissal of parliament and plans for a referendum to allow him a third term have sparked deep concern, with the opposition calling it a coup bid in the uranium-producing nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	2	390	564	Mamadou Tandja, a former colonel elected president in 1999 following a military coup, on Friday announced he would go ahead with plans for a referendum on a new constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	3	574	678	If approved, it would allow him to stay in power after his second five-year term expires on December 22. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	4	688	824	His announcement came after the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, said Monday it was opposed to the holding of the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	5	834	976	On Tuesday, Tandja dissolved parliament, which was reportedly on the verge of objecting to his plans, before it could make its position known. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	6	977	1028	Tandja, 71, did not give a date for the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	7	1038	1085	The moves caused alarm at both home and abroad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	8	1095	1308	Niger's main opposition group said it sees Tanjda's determination to push ahead with the referendum despite the refusal of the nation's highest court and the reluctance of parliament as being tantamount to a coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	9	1318	1442	"Right from the minute Tandja says he was calling a referendum, he ... loses his legitimacy as he'll have proclaimed a coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	10	1443	1562	We will treat him as a mere putschist," Hassoumi Massaoudou of the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	11	1572	1782	Tandja took part in the 1974 coup that toppled the country's first civilian president, Diori Hamani, and was a pillar of the military regime that governed Niger until the advent of multi-party politics in 1991. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	12	1792	1977	Both the United States and Canada expressed concern about the developments in the country, which despite being a major uranium producer has also been one of the world's poorest nations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	13	1987	2298	"We believe this risks undercutting Niger's hard won social, political, and economic gains of the past decade, and would be a set-back for democracy, based on the regular, peaceful transition of political power and faithful adherence to constitutional due-process," said US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	14	2299	2554	Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said in a statement that his country was following the events "with concern" and "considers that respect for the integrity of democratic institutions and mechanisms is paramount to a firm commitment to democracy." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	15	2564	2637	One analyst said the president's actions were a reminder of past turmoil. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	16	2647	2870	"The history of Niger has shown that once there is political impasse ... the military tends to intervene," Abubakar Sadiq, a political science professor at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria in neighbouring Nigeria, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	17	2880	2938	"This is why what Tandja is doing is very, very dangerous. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	18	2948	3082	"Tandja of course belongs to the military class, being a former colonel ... but that is not a guarantee the military will not strike." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	19	3092	3238	Parliamentarians from French-speaking countries, meeting in Dakar earlier this week, also called for the "strict respect" of Niger's constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	20	3248	3403	The regional grouping the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) warned that Niger could face sanctions if it forged ahead with the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	21	3413	3566	But Libyan leader and current African Union head Moamer Khadafi, himself in power for the past four decades, was more understanding of Tandja's position. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	22	3576	3732	"If the people decide the president deserves to be re-elected, they can choose him once, three times or even 10 times," he said at a regional summit Friday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	23	3742	3834	Sadiq said "the world should not keep quiet and allow the rape of democracy again in Niger." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	24	3844	3952	"The situation in Niger Republic is symptomatic of a trend in Africa where democracy is not well entrenched. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	25	3953	4081	Virtually all African leaders don't respect democratic institutions, they only want to remain in power until they die," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	26	4091	4264	"Pressure has to be brought to bear on Tandja by the whole Nigerian nation, the African Union and the international community to respect the constitution of Niger Republic."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	1	174	374	Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze to all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that have raised tensions between the close allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	2	384	623	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	3	633	857	The premier himself did not address the issue at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting, but the fighting words were echoed by other members of the largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party Labour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	4	867	1092	A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on its close ally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	5	1102	1230	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	6	1231	1296	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	7	1306	1354	"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	8	1355	1503	They're not even ready to meet the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the Americans to do all the work," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	9	1513	1698	Abbas, who met Obama last week, 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has vowed that that he will not relaunch talks unless Israel freezes settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	10	1708	1913	The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the settlements, including the so-called natural growth construction that allows for building to accommodate a growing population. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	11	1923	2172	The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells in Israel that the new US president could put pressure on the Jewish state as part of his new approach to the Muslim world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	12	2182	2328	"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not accept," Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	13	2338	2624	Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party that is the most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is black and white or write or wrong is wrong." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	14	2634	2752	More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank, which Israeli captured in war in 1967. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	15	2753	2815	The international community considers all settlements illegal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	16	2825	2978	Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	17	2979	3034	Bush sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	18	3044	3235	Bush said that given the existence of major Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part of a final peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	19	3245	3382	"This administration has not yet recognised the arrangements made between the Israeli government and the Bush administration," said Katz. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	20	3383	3439	"That can only raise concerns over future arrangements." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	21	3449	3696	Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and Israel over the creation of a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was committed to the principle and Netanyahu thus far refusing to endorse it in public.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	1	172	364	One Yemeni protestor was killed and five others wounded on Sunday in clashes with police who used firearms to break up an anti-government demonstration in southern Yemen, medical sources said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	2	374	447	"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	3	448	584	He was hit by a bullet," medical sources said after the incident in Dali, 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of the southern port of Aden. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	4	594	742	Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators who carried banners with slogans against the government, which is controlled by northerners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	5	752	816	The demonstration in Dali was on its second day, witnesses said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	6	826	956	Twelve other Yemenis, including four soldiers, have been killed in clashes in the south since demonstrations broke out late April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	7	957	1032	The Sanaa government has blamed the demonstrations on southern separatists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	8	1042	1119	South Yemen was united in 1990 with North Yemen to form the current republic.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	1	193	400	French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times, pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	2	410	610	The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	3	620	721	Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a large electric output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	4	731	881	These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	5	891	1106	That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	6	1116	1228	But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the relative slowness of magnetic sensors. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	7	1238	1532	In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	8	1542	1724	"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage surface, Bigot told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	9	1734	1832	Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a second, said Bigot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	10	1842	2013	Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10 centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics, he cautioned. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	11	2023	2117	Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over the next decade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	12	2127	2218	IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research, Bigot said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	1	172	348	Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between the ages of 15 and 45. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	2	358	573	Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730 men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	3	583	706	Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	4	716	777	The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	5	787	1097	"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of Surrey. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	6	1107	1211	"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working on identifying the rest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	7	1221	1328	The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are precursors in sperm development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	8	1338	1516	Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said in a press release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	9	1526	1552	Why this is so is unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	10	1553	1657	Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and seems to be far higher than for other cancer types. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	11	1667	1867	Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of patients, the risk is four to six times higher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	12	1877	1961	Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	1	193	369	With less than two weeks until Iran's presidential election, Islamshahr -- a city of migrant workers on the outskirts of Tehran -- is gearing up for an intense election battle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	2	379	532	Located southwest of the capital, Islamshahr, a city of 500,000 inhabitants, had largely voted for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during the 2005 presidential poll. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	3	542	677	But four years on, the situation has changed in the city of migrants who have come from various provinces of Iran to earn a livelihood. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	4	687	886	Ahmadinejad, who is seeking a second term in office, is still popular in Islamshahr, but his key challenger in the June 12 poll -- former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi -- is making deep inroads. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	5	896	1082	While the incumbent conservative president appears to be assured of the support of middle and lower income voters, Mousavi is gaining popularity among the city's shopkeepers and traders. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	6	1092	1153	He was due to address a campaign rally in the city on Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	7	1124	1283	Military analysts say any North Korean action would likely be staged well away from Jeju, but timed to coincide with the summit to cause maximum embarrassment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	8	1293	1442	Security was tight, with a surface-to-air missile unit set up next to the convention centre, checkpoints on major roads and explosives-sniffing dogs.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	1	191	388	Thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to commemorate the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing 20 years ago, including one of the leaders from Tiananmen Square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	2	398	613	Organisers said around 5,000 people rallied through the streets of the city to mark the anniversary of the military crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead following weeks of protests in the capital.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	8	1289	1355	The attendance at the march was sharply up on last year's figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	9	1356	1435	An annual candlelit vigil on Thursday is expected to attract tens of thousands.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	11	1659	1756	His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism of the crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	12	1757	1816	Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry in the past.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	1	182	325	Troops killed 12 Taliban linked to a battle with US troops earlier this month that caused scores of civilian casualties, officials said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	2	335	523	Afghan and US forces raided late Saturday a group of militants said to have gathered to plan an attack in Afghanistan's southwestern province of Farah, the deputy provincial governor said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	4	604	732	Taliban fought back but all of the 12, including their commander, were killed," deputy governor Mohammad Younus Rasoli told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	5	742	938	The raid was in the district of Khaki Safed which adjoins Bala Buluk, where heavy fighting between insurgents and troops in early May led the soldiers to call in air strikes that killed villagers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	6	948	1047	The Afghan government said 140 civilians, many of them children, were killed in the US air strikes.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	8	1148	1291	A spokesman for the Afghan military in western Afghanistan, Basir Khan Ghori, said the targeted group was involved in the battle in Bala Buluk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	9	1301	1454	The militants had also shot rockets into the town of Farah on May 19 when President Hamid Karzai had visited to meet victims of the air strikes, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	10	1464	1571	There were reports of rockets fired into the town the night before the visit but they caused no casualties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	11	1581	1815	Government figures for those killed and wounded in the Bala Buluk strikes makes it one of the deadliest incidents for civilians since international troops invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 to remove the Taliban for sheltering Al-Qaeda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	12	1825	1939	Rasoli, the deputy governor, said troops would continue operating to secure the area ahead of August 20 elections.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	1	193	389	Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was dealt a blow Saturday when she lost out to a troupe of young street dancers in the final of the British talent show that made her a global star. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	2	399	613	Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her final performance on live television, Boyle, 48, graciously accepted second place, saying the "best people won" and wishing the winners "all the best". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	3	623	819	Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	4	829	1039	It has had about 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi who embraced the dowdy spinster from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	5	1049	1271	Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final performance there were fears the unemployed church volunteer, who lives alone with her cat outside Edinburgh, was suffering under the pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	6	1281	1432	In a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, however, Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	8	1625	1810	Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to perform for Queen Elizabeth II. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	9	1820	2030	More than one million viewers cast their vote following the live performances -- but in the end, Boyle lost out to a multi-ethnic posse of 10 street dancers aged 12 to 25 from London and Essex called Diversity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	10	2040	2167	Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress -- gushed appreciation for her worldwide fan base. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	11	2177	2249	"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	12	2259	2336	Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!...

AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	14	2398	2621	Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on YouTube questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	15	2631	2797	News media meanwhile reported some erratic behaviour over the past week, including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she was staying.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	17	3004	3126	But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have never heard such powerful confident vocals." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	18	3136	3344	Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could strike it rich if she capitalises on her global success, with the News of the World saying one of the show's judges, music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans for her.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	3	610	797	The gunfight erupted when police tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the commander of Hamas's armed wing in northern West Bank who was also on Israel's wanted list, police and Hamas said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	4	807	1005	Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas militant and refused to come out, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	5	1015	1103	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	6	1104	1201	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	7	1211	1403	Hamas, which has been at odds with the Fatah movement of the Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas ever since the Islamists seized control of Gaza in 2007, lashed out over the incident. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	8	1413	1610	"Hamas puts the complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces," Hamas said in a statement released in Gaza, adding that Samman had been wanted by Israel for six years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	9	1611	1638	"This crime is a red line." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	10	1648	1775	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas warned it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	11	1776	1870	"Hamas will examine its options concerning this collaborator gang responsible for this crime." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	12	1880	2103	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks between the rivals following the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	13	2113	2213	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	14	2223	2388	The two factions have been divided since June 2007, when Hamas booted Abbas's secular Fatah party out of Gaza, leaving him in control only in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	15	2398	2580	They held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals of campaigns of persecution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	16	2590	2687	The Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet on May 20, further widening the rift.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0333	1	174	301	Two Turks who travelled to the United States have been diagnosed with swine flu after returning home, the health ministry said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0333	2	311	539	"The patients, whose general condition is good, have been isolated and put under monitoring," the statement said late Saturday, adding one of them was hospitalised in Istanbul, while the second in the western port city of Izmir.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	2	378	571	The elections are seen as a test of the country's governing coalition's ability to handle the effects of the global economic crisis, which sent the Adriatic country into recession in late 2008. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	3	581	663	Some four million voters were being asked to elect 221 mayors and municipal heads.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	11	1597	1818	Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right- wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	12	1828	2015	The polls give voters the right for the first time to directly elect mayors, county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county assemblies and more than 550 city and town councils.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	1	177	301	Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	2	311	494	"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," Nguyen Huy Nga, the ministry's spokesman, told AFP, adding the case was "confirmed officially by our ministry this morning." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	3	504	690	An initial test conducted Saturday at the tropical diseases hospital in southern Ho Chi Minh City was positive, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the city's Pasteur Institute, told AFP earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	4	700	768	The patient was in a stable condition with a slight fever, Tu added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	5	778	917	State television reported that the patient is a 23-year-old student who returned home early last week from the United States via Hong Kong. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	6	927	1100	Emergence of the virus in Vietnam was "highly likely" given its international travel links, Shelaye Boothey, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	7	1110	1172	"They've had some good detection measures in place," she said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	1	187	385	The once mighty US auto industry faces a day of reckoning on Monday with the looming bankruptcy of General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	2	395	622	The global economic crisis has hit the US industry hard, prompting massive intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new blow to the nation's economy, which is already in recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	3	632	755	A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	4	765	982	With the hours counting down for GM, company bondholders with slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt voted Saturday in support of the restructuring plan, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	5	992	1104	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	6	1105	1225	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	7	1235	1402	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	8	1412	1533	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	9	1543	1680	Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	10	1690	1815	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	11	1825	1987	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	12	1997	2152	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	13	2162	2349	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	14	2359	2435	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	15	2436	2483	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	16	2493	2693	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	17	2703	2872	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	18	2882	3076	The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this summer, The Detroit Free Press reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	19	3086	3180	Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the newspaper report. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	20	3181	3250	This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be running. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	21	3260	3433	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	22	3443	3593	The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government, amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	23	3603	3688	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	24	3698	3945	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	25	3955	4069	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	26	4079	4206	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	27	4216	4300	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	28	4301	4448	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	29	4458	4670	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	30	4680	4764	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	31	4765	4844	Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by June 15.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	1	193	384	Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for international support in dismantling the global political network of the Tamil Tiger rebels after declaring a full military victory over the separatist movement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	2	394	619	Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in Singapore that Colombo needed help in disabling the Tigers' "powerful political lobbies in certain capitals" that are seeking to resurrect the movement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	3	629	802	"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist the government of Sri Lanka, to track down the global network of the LTTE," Bogollagama said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	4	812	1017	Speaking at the forum organised by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Bogollagama also rejected allegations of genocide in the last days of the Sri Lankan military's battle against the LTTE. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	5	1027	1209	"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of Sri Lanka," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	6	1219	1370	There have been allegations that large numbers of civilians had been killed as the Sri Lankan army closed in on the rebels to end the decades-long war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	7	1380	1494	Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday called for an independent probe into the number of civilian deaths. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	8	1504	1681	A day earlier, The Times of London newspaper had cited what it said were confidential UN reports stating that more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Sri Lankan army shelling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	9	1691	1778	But Bogollagama said the campaign to crush the rebels was a model for others to follow. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	10	1788	2093	"Sri Lanka will, no doubt, enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism, whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	11	2103	2190	The LTTE's fall would also strike a blow to international terrorism, the minister said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	12	2200	2460	"The elimination of the LTTE from Sri Lanka as a terror organisation would prevent other facets of terrorism, such as money laundering, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling, arms smuggling, and other means of terrorist networking the world over ..." he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	13	2470	2571	Bogollagama also emphasised the importance of the immediate post-war actions taken by the government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	14	2581	2652	"This post-conflict phase is crucial in restoring confidence in people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	15	2653	2825	We know these chances won't come all the time, and some chances only come once, and this is one such chance that we have got, and we will not miss out on this opportunity." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	16	2835	3028	He said the rehabilitation and resettlement of the 280,000 refugees displaced by the conflict was one of the key priorities of the Sri Lankan government, promising they would be treated fairly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	17	3038	3129	"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	18	3130	3305	We'll have an inclusive process in this regard, and we'll have everyone who is conscious of our country onboard irrespective whatever ethnic identity one might have by birth." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	19	3315	3419	The LTTE launched a bloody campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the Sinhalese-majority island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	20	3420	3477	Much of its funding came from Tamil communities overseas.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	1	184	378	Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained diplomatic relations with New Delhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	2	388	608	What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has spiralled into a crisis that prompted talks between Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on student safety last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	3	618	845	Students and Indian officials are demanding action after more than 70 assaults on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past fortnight, attracting prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	4	855	1028	Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across front pages in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	5	1029	1074	A teenager faces charges of attempted murder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	6	1084	1233	"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	7	1243	1388	Another student, Baljinder Singh, told last week how his attackers laughed as he pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train station. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	8	1398	1625	"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound to his stomach and has advised Indians to stay away from Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	9	1635	1822	Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", a term reportedly used by youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western suburbs, where 30 percent of assault victims are Indian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	10	1832	1959	It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million with an Indian student population of less than 50,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	11	1969	2172	Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late with items such as mobile phones and MP3 players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	12	2182	2318	But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said racism was playing a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	13	2328	2514	Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more than 1,000 supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police attitude had frustrated students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	14	2524	2661	Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	15	2671	2847	While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children studying in Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	16	2857	3029	That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000 Indians nationwide. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	17	3039	3220	More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is sustaining long-term damage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	18	3230	3502	"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told commercial television Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	19	3512	3733	There are already signs the controversy is souring popular attitudes in India towards Australia, with Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan threatening to snub the offer of an honorary doctorate from an Australian university.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	21	3926	4141	Theerthala's assault proved the catalyst for widespread anger in India, sparking a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public statements from Indian officials indicating they had run out of patience. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	22	4151	4224	"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," High Commissioner Singh said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	1	185	374	The All Blacks selectors Sunday named a largely predictable squad for their opening Tests of the year and then delivered a stinging criticism of their defensive performance in the Super 14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	2	384	492	The 26-man squad for two Tests against France and one against Italy next month includes only three new caps. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	3	493	585	Veteran fullback Mils Muliaina takes over the captaincy, replacing the injured Richie McCaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	4	595	809	It was the one bright spot for Muliaina in an otherwise dismal weekend with the All Blacks named just hours after he led his Waikato Chiefs to an inglorious 17-61 defeat by the Northern Bulls in the Super 14 final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	5	819	983	But head coach Graham Henry maintained that game had no bearing on the All Blacks squad which, with several big names sidelined by injury, was finalised a week ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	6	993	1201	In addition to McCaw, loose forwards Rodney So'oialo and Scott Waldrom, wing Sitiveni Sivivatu, lock Anthony Boric, scrumhalf Andy Ellis, hooker Corey Flynn and flyhalf Daniel Carter were also not considered. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	7	1211	1374	Two other injured players, scrumhalf Brendon Leonard and lock Ali Williams, have been selected but are unlikely to be considered for the first Test against France. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	8	1384	1583	With the exception of the three new internationals -- prop Wyatt Crockett, lock Isaac Ross and loose forward Tanerau Latimer -- the selectors have stayed loyal to players with proven Test experience. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	9	1593	1753	The All Blacks will play two Tests against France, on June 13 in Dunedin and June 20 in Wellington, and a one-off Test against Italy in Christchurch on June 27. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	10	1763	1839	"France will again be a difficult challenge for the All Blacks," Henry said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	11	1849	1966	"They have picked their strongest squad available and history shows they are often successful against the All Blacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	12	1976	2016	"Italy will bring a different challenge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	13	2017	2173	They will be well coached by the very experienced South African coach Nick Mallet and will bring a lot of physicality and scrummaging power to the contest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	14	2183	2325	Following the Italy Test the All Blacks squad will be reassessed for the Tri- Nations series with Australia and South Africa starting in July. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	15	2335	2457	With the first Test less than two weeks away, Henry has little time to work on areas where he sees a need for improvement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	16	2467	2558	"I thought the defence generally speaking in the Super 14 was not up to standard," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	17	2568	2739	"I've been having a good look at it over the past couple of weeks and been quite disappointed, quite frankly, at the general level of tackling ability of the top players." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	18	2749	2971	With Dan Carter likely to be out for the international season as he continues to recover from a ruptured Achilles tendon, Stephen Donald is the only specialist flyhalf in the squad with scrumhalf Piri Weepu as his back up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	19	2981	3206	Former international flyhalf Luke McAlister, who recently ended his contract with the English club Sale, has been named in the Junior All Blacks, an effective B team, and is likely to return to the A side for the Tri Nations.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	1	195	400	Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but little progress in treating colorectal cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	2	410	635	Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	3	645	786	The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	4	796	1002	Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth slow more than a control group treated with Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	5	1012	1108	More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or Avastin and Tarceva. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	6	1109	1302	Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8 months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	7	1312	1446	The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	8	1456	1700	"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said Miller. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	9	1710	1855	A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	10	1865	2029	Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	11	2039	2136	As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard chemotherapy sessions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	12	2146	2308	"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the research. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	13	2318	2567	"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients' lives," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	14	2577	2743	However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest type of cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	15	2753	3028	Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when compared to those not taking the drug. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	16	3038	3285	Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer surgery. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	17	3295	3449	On Sunday, several sessions at the ASCO event, scheduled to end on Tuesday, will focus on the result of clinical tests on female breast and uterus cancer.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	1	189	383	US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes his first trip to Beijing Sunday, exploiting his early links with China to steer relations with the Asian giant under President Barack Obama's watch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	2	393	690	Having started on the wrong foot by criticizing China for currency manipulation, Geithner will now have to grapple with issues ranging from key Chinese holdings of dollar based assets to the global economic turmoil when he meets President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and others during his visit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	3	700	1001	But analysts are confident that his previous Chinese connections will come a long way to establishing links with the leadership in Beijing as the Obama administration banks on China's credit to bankroll the recession-struck US economy and its growing influence to help ease the global economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	4	1011	1234	This despite the fact that he lacks the firm business background of his predecessor, Henry Paulson, reputedly the most well-connected post-war Treasury Secretary, having travelled extensively to Beijing as a private banker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	5	1244	1315	"Yes, he doesn't quite have the same business background as that of Mr. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	6	1316	1486	Paulson but I think Mr Geithner will turn that to his advantage," said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	7	1496	1527	"I think quite frankly that Mr. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	8	1528	1688	Geithner will be a better listener with the Chinese," he said, citing Paulson's sometimes "very strong advice" to the Chinese on reforming the financial system. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	9	1698	1789	"Now they recognize that what Paulson was advocating did not turn up so well," Lardy added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	14	2486	2642	His father Peter Geithner was also the first representative in Beijing for the Ford Foundation, possibly the oldest US non-government organization in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	15	2652	2861	Obama administration officials took pains to emphasize the Treasury chief's Chinese connections at a media briefing before his departure from Washington Saturday for his two day Beijing visit beginning Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	16	2871	3073	Geithner would deliver a speech at Peking university, his alma mater, during the trip and "will meet with students and with professors and we hope with some former professors of his," one official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	17	3083	3318	He would also visit the offices of the Ford Foundation, which has funded economics education in the United States of a large group of Chinese who are now senior officials, academics and members of the economic establishment in Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	18	3328	3432	"Coincidentally, the Ford Foundation was established by secretary Geithner's father," the official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	19	3442	3644	Despite his history with China, Geithner created a stir at his confirmation hearing in January when he said in a written reply to a senator that Obama "believes that China is manipulating its currency." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	20	3654	3777	It triggered a storm in China and signaled that Obama will take the Chinese head on over the currency manipulation charges. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	21	3787	3970	But Obama administration officials swiftly moved to contain the damage, saying the reply was written by midlevel staff helping Geithner answer the plethora of questions from senators. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	22	3980	4047	On taking office, Geithner also rapidly reached out to the Chinese. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	23	4057	4247	"I have talked to my counterparts in China over the past few months much more than I’ve talked to my counterparts from any other country," he told the New York Times in a recent interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	24	4257	4471	In Beijing however Geithner faces the tough task of convincing the Chinese to maintain their massive US bond holdings under threat by burgeoning US debt and prodding them to make their their currency more flexible. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	25	4481	4679	Being the top holder of the bonds, China is the largest creditor to the United States aside from being the world's largest holder of US dollars as a reserve currency, at nearly two trillion dollars.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0344	23	3926	4132	"ASEAN leaders will meet and discuss an issue that has received international attention -- about a neighbouring country -- for further cooperation," the Thai premier said in his weekly television programme.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	1	203	388	Pakistani troops killed at least 28 suspected militants on Sunday in fierce clashes in a restive northwest tribal area and known Taliban bolthole near the Afghan border, officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	2	398	584	Battles broke out before dawn in South Waziristan when militants attacked army checkpoints and other security posts in the towns of Jandola and Spinkai Raghzai, a security official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	3	594	708	"Forces retaliated and repulsed the attack after a bloody clash," said the official, who did not want to be named. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	4	718	810	"Militants were forced to run before dawn leaving behind some of the dead bodies," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	5	820	949	Syed Ahmad, a police official in the tribal area, told AFP that at least 28 militants and one soldier were killed in the clashes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	6	959	1095	"According to my information, 28 coffins were purchased from a local market but I believe that the number of dead is more," he told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	7	1105	1180	The security official put the death toll at 40 militants and four soldiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	8	1190	1377	Pakistan's lawless tribal areas have been beset by violence since Afghanistan's Taliban regime was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion, prompting hundreds of fighters to flood the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0345	9	1387	1606	Security forces are currently locked in a fierce offensive against Taliban militants in three other northwest districts, and there have been reports -- which the army denies -- that the assault may expand to Waziristan.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	1	182	349	Gruelling efforts to craft a pact on climate change enter a crucial phase on Monday when the 192-nation UN forum takes its first look at a draft text for negotiations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	2	359	568	The 12-day huddle in the German city of Bonn under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) means that, after 18 months of swapping visions, the process will at last get down to the gritty stuff. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	3	578	817	Little more than six months are left before the "Bali Road Map", launched in Indonesia in 2006, reaches its supposed destination at a Copenhagen summit: an accord that will transform global warming from a monster into a manageable problem. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	4	827	955	On the table is a small mountain of paper whose notable feature is curly brackets, denoting discord among scores of submissions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	5	965	1145	Despite the sprawling range of proposals, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer said he hoped that the draft will be endorsed as a workable basis for talks over the coming months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	6	1155	1235	"There will be a negotiating text on the table for the first time," he told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	7	1245	1383	"I hope it will be well received, that it will be seen as a balanced representation of the different ideas that countries have come with." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	8	1393	1480	The big goal is to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	9	1490	1530	But that's where consensus largely ends. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	10	1531	1569	Exactly how deep should be the cut be? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	11	1570	1593	How can it be achieved? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	12	1594	1629	And who should shoulder the burden? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	13	1639	1836	In their proposals, many developing countries say rich countries, which bear historical responsibility for today's warming, should take the lead by cutting their emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	14	1846	1913	China has led the charge, demanding a cut of "at least" 40 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	15	1923	2105	But only the European Union (EU), which has set its own reduction of 20 percent by 2020, deepened to 30 percent if other advanced economies play ball, is anywhere near such a figure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	16	2115	2258	After eight long years of vilification, the United States is now being warmly embraced in the climate arena as Barack Obama bulldozes George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	17	2259	2275	Bush's policies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	18	2285	2354	But Washington is also warning that the world cannot expect miracles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	19	2364	2507	A bill put before Congress would cut US emissions by 17 percent by 2020 over 2005 levels using a cap-and-trade system of the kind Bush loathed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	20	2517	2741	This approach would translate to a reduction of only four percent compared to the 1990 benchmark, but it would also ratchet up to 83 percent by 2050, the top US climate change negotiator, Todd Stern, said in Paris last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	21	2751	2904	"We are jumping as high as the political system will tolerate," said Stern, characterising China's demand of a 40 percent cut by 2020 as "not realistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	22	2914	2980	Just as unresolved is what the emerging giant countries should do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	23	2990	3123	The draft should at least "call for those wealthier, more capable countries to take actions," said Stern's deputy, Jonathan Pershing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	24	3133	3263	China is now the world's No. 1 polluter, and Brazil and India have also leapt up the emission ranks as their economies have grown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	25	3273	3456	Yet all refuse binding emissions targets of the kind that apply only to rich countries under the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCCC treaty to be superseded from 2013 by the Copenhagen accord. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	26	3466	3672	Then there is how to muster finance to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, and how to transfer clean technology so that they avoid becoming the greenhouse-gas villains of the future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	27	3682	3843	Keya Chatterjee, deputy director of the climate change programme with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said emerging countries were thirsting for the energy switch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	28	3853	3959	"It's sort of a green arms race where everybody wants to have access to clean- energy industry," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	29	3960	4040	"That's a pretty huge change in the negotiations that will affect the dynamics." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	30	4050	4106	Even so, she said, developing countries were suspicious. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	31	4107	4219	"This lack of trust comes from a long tradition of industrialised countries not living up to their obligations." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	32	4229	4300	These are just a few of the many obstacles besetting the Bali Road Map. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	33	4310	4449	The complexity is such that many experts now predict Copenhagen will not be a complete treaty but, at best, a good deal on the main points. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	34	4459	4756	"I think that what we are looking at in Copenhagen is a deal that will lock in some specific emission reductions goals, will create commitments both for investment and adaptation and then... the details will have to be filled in later," said Angela Anderson of the US Climate Action Network (CAN). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	0	58	109	US and Russia hold second round of START arms talks 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	1	183	378	Russian and US negotiators are due to meet in Geneva on Monday for a second round of talks on renewing a key Cold War-era arms reduction deal, a month before their leaders hold a landmark summit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	2	388	591	Diplomats said the three day meeting on the START treaty would be held behind closed doors at an undisclosed location, mirroring the discretion surrounding the first round in Moscow nearly two weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	3	601	689	"On the details of the negotiation, I think we prefer to keep that in private right now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	4	690	823	I think that's just the best way to conduct these kinds of negotiations," US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	5	833	1015	First results from the talks are expected to be unveiled by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev during their summit meeting in Moscow on July 6 to 8, a Russian diplomat said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	6	1025	1238	Despite a thaw in US-Russian relations following the departure of the Bush administration, analysts were expecting little concrete progress on the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires on December 5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	7	1248	1508	On top of the complex technical issues surrounding the landmark treaty -- which took a decade to reach agreement on the deep cuts in US and Soviet nuclear arsenals after the fall of the Iron Curtain -- the negotiations are also hampered by differing ambitions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	8	1518	1558	"The sides are not in the same position. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	9	1559	1703	Obama needs a result to demonstrate that the 'reset' of US-Russian relations is getting somewhere," said Evgeny Volk of the Heritage Foundation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	10	1713	1909	Earlier this year, Vice President Joseph Biden unveiled the Obama administration's fresh approach to fractious US relations with the old Cold War foe, saying it wanted to press the 'reset' button. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	11	1919	2184	Disarmament expert Jozef Goldblat said the START talks allowed the United States to create a climate "propitious for help with other more complicated subjects" where Washington needs Moscow's support, such as Iran and North Korea's controversial nuclear programmes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	12	2194	2361	However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not concealed Moscow's desire to broaden the talks to take account of the planned US anti-missile shield in Europe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	13	2371	2466	The United States has insisted that the defensive shield is meant to counter an Iranian threat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	14	2476	2622	But Russia regards the shield, which would partly be based in former eastern bloc countries close to its borders, as a threat to its own security. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	15	2632	2703	"The number one stumbling block is the anti missile shield," said Volk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	16	2704	2787	"Moscow wants Washington to give up deployment but the Americans are against that." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	17	2797	2908	Russian military analyst Alexander Goltz said the negotiations also helped Moscow recover some of its prestige. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	18	2918	3060	"The Russians are aiming to make the process last as long as possible, because the talks restore their status as a world power," he explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	19	3070	3295	Russian officials hailed the "constructive and business-like" atmosphere of the first round, but US delegation chief Rose Gottemoeller warned before the talks even began that the process could be more drawn out than expected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	20	3305	3407	Goltz played down expectations for the Obama-Medvedev summit because the two sides were too far apart. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	21	3417	3633	But veteran disarmament observer Goldblat suggested an elegant way out: a five year extension of START that would give time for negotiations on a "broader" disarmament deal between the world's biggest nuclear powers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	0	58	113	Major security plan drawn up for Lebanon vote: minister 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	1	187	384	Lebanon will deploy 50,000 police and soldiers to prevent any outbreak of violence during the June 7 parliamentary election as part of a major security plan, Interior Minister Ziad Baroud has said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	2	394	584	"We will have 30,000 police and soldiers deployed at polling stations and their vicinity and 20,000 other police and soldiers deployed elsewhere nationwide," Baroud told AFP in an interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	3	594	844	He said the plan takes into account sensitive regions where violence could erupt on election day between members of the current Western-backed ruling majority and supporters of the Hezbollah-led opposition alliance, which is backed by Iran and Syria. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	4	854	1050	Sectarian violence between the two sides left around 100 people dead last May when Hezbollah staged a spectacular takeover of mainly Sunni parts of west Beirut, prompting fears of a new civil war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	5	1060	1188	Baroud said security measures on election day had taken into account the risk of violence in each of the 26 electoral districts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	6	1198	1281	"In some districts there is minimal risk and in others it's more serious," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	7	1282	1351	"And it's according to the risk factor that troops will be deployed." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	8	1361	1525	For example, he said there was little likelihood of violence erupting in most of the regions in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah and its allies are assured victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	9	1535	1724	However, the situation is expected to be more tense in regions where the vote is set to be tight, including the southern coastal town of Sidon and in the eastern Bekaa valley town of Zahle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	10	1734	1889	Baroud said he was nonetheless optimistic the vote would proceed smoothly, noting that there had been few security incidents in the run-up to the election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	11	1899	2024	"Of course, I am anxious ... but the political situation (locally and regionally) is more reassuring than alarming," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	12	2034	2155	"It's up to the country's political factions and every Lebanese man or woman to ensure there is no outbreak of violence." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	13	2165	2372	Baroud, 39, a widely popular minister in the current 30-member national unity government in which Hezbollah is represented, said measures had also been adopted to prevent fraud at the 5,200 polling stations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	14	2382	2489	The vote this year for the first time is taking place on a single day rather than over a month-long period. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	15	2499	2672	"We have taken anti-fraud measures including placing transparent boxes in polling stations, more secrecy of voting and we have adopted international standards," Baroud said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	16	2682	2763	"Also the indelible ink we will be using will prevent someone from voting twice." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	17	2773	2948	Some 2,200 national observers and 250 international monitors will oversee the vote including from the European Union, the Carter Center, the Arab League and several countries. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	18	2958	3037	The 128 seats in parliament are divided equally between Christians and Muslims. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	19	3047	3158	Baroud said he expected final results to be announced on June 8, barring any major security incidents or fraud. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	20	3168	3221	"I am crossing my fingers on a daily basis," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0350	1	189	344	Nearly half of the land occupied by Israeli settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank is private Palestinian property, a watchdog group said on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0350	2	354	479	Forty-four percent of the land where the wildcat settlements were built belong to private Palestinian owners, Peace Now said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0350	3	489	681	The vast majority of the outposts -- 80 of the more than 100 in the territory -- were either partially or wholly built on private Palestinian land without authorisation of the owners, it said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	1	180	357	South Korea may cancel a shipment of steel to North Korea for power plant repairs in protest at its nuclear test, which sparked international condemnation, a report said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	2	367	506	Seoul is considering auctioning off the steel plates, which have been kept at a state warehouse, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	3	516	643	"We cannot ship steel plates because of North Korea's nuclear test," an unnamed foreign ministry official was quoted as saying.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	2	391	643	"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned," Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security forum in Singapore.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	11	1508	1653	"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	12	1663	1854	Critics say Myanmar's military regime trumped up the charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0353	1	203	349	Seven Muslim separatist guerrillas died after a foiled attack on a military outpost in the southern Philippines, a military spokesman said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0353	2	359	564	Rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) attacked the military in Datu Piang town in Mindanao late Saturday in an attempt to destroy artillery at the base, said Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ponce. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0353	3	574	702	"Seven rebels were killed in the fighting, but there could be more as the MILF forces retreated with their wounded," said Ponce.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	1	194	384	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces hunted down the militant leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	2	394	623	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	3	633	745	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," the secretary of defence said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	4	755	891	"Only five to ten percent job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	5	901	1098	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	6	1108	1318	Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and neighbouring Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	7	1328	1514	"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he announced the Mingora win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	8	1524	1723	Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	12	2404	2635	Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that beheaded opponents, burned scores of schools and fought against government troops since November 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	13	2645	2792	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat and has listed their names and published mugshots. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	14	2802	2942	But as the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks on cities across Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	15	2952	3150	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0356	1	168	362	Iranian security officials defused a handmade bomb on board a domestic flight, officials said on Sunday, the latest violence  the run-up to Iran's presidential election less than two weeks away. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0356	2	372	527	The incident occurred on a Kish Air flight headed to Tehran from Ahvaz in the west of the country near the border with Iraq, the Fars news agency reported.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0356	7	1133	1311	It was the latest unrest to shake Iran in the run-up to the country's presidential election on June 12, while Ahvaz itself has witnessed several deadly incidents in recent years.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0356	9	1512	1731	The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam, has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0357	1	186	327	Spanish league strugglers Espanyol have joined the race to sign Japan and Celtic midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura, media here reported on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0357	2	337	469	There will be no transfer fee required to get Nakamura, who turns 31 in late June, when his contract with Celtic expires next month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0357	3	479	700	"It is true they (Espanyol) have approached us," Nakamura's agent Roberto Tsukuda told the Daily Sports newspaper, which also reported that Celtic have formally offered to extend their deal with the left-footed playmaker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0357	4	710	821	But Nakamura is widely reported to be on the verge of signing with his old J-League home club Yokohama Marinos.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	1	186	386	One of the 21 "most-wanted" Tiananmen Square protesters has been allowed to enter Hong Kong, a surprise move ahead of the 20th anniversary of the crackdown on the demonstrations, a report said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	2	396	611	Xiong Yan, who was a leading student protester during the 1989 demonstrations in Beijing and now lives in exile in the United States, was allowed into Hong Kong without questioning, the Sunday Morning Post reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	3	621	791	"I have not been to China for 17 years and... just feel very happy to be back in the motherland," said Xiong, who is now a chaplain in the US army, according to the Post. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	4	792	835	He arrived in the city on Saturday evening. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	5	845	1077	Xiong plans to join the annual candlelight vigil in the city this Thursday, where tens of thousands are expected to mark the military crackdown on pro- democracy protests, which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead across Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	6	1087	1268	He is also launching a book about his life, including his role in the protests and his experiences during the Iraq War, where he was posted in 2004, the English-language paper said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	7	1278	1453	Several other Tiananmen dissidents have been denied entry to Hong Kong in recent years, although the city operates a separate legal and immigration system from mainland China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	8	1463	1655	Commenting on Xiong's reported entry, chairman of the city's Democratic Party Albert Ho, told AFP he was surprised and said it was "probably due to an omission" by the immigration authorities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	9	1665	1791	Xiong told the Post he would continue his fight for democracy so "people in China can live with freedom like America one day." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	10	1801	1918	Travelling on his US passport, the 45-year-old father-of-two said he was relieved to have been allowed into the city. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0358	11	1919	2020	"In the weeks leading up to this trip I couldn't sleep at night, I was so nervous," he told the Post.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	1	187	354	A Swedish party which wants an Internet filesharing free-for-all, the Pirate Party, could become one of the surprise new entrants to the European parliament this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	2	364	611	The party, which also wants to beef up Internet privacy, was founded in January 2006 and quickly attracted members angered by controversial laws adopted in the Scandinavian country that criminalised filesharing and authorised monitoring of emails. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	3	621	793	Its membership shot up after a Stockholm court on April 17 sentenced four Swedes to a year in jail for running one of the world's biggest filesharing sites, The Pirate Bay. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	4	803	935	"When the verdict was announced at 11:00 am, we had 14,711 members," Rick Falkvinge, the 37-year-old founder of the party, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	5	945	1031	"We tripled in a week, becoming the third-biggest party in Sweden in terms of numbers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	6	1032	1068	All of a sudden we were everywhere." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	7	1078	1253	Opinion polls ahead of the June 7 European parliament elections credit the party with between 5.5 and 7.9 percent of votes, well above the four percent required to win a seat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	8	1263	1379	In the 2006 general election, held eight months after it's creation, the Pirate Party won just 0.6 percent of votes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	9	1389	1642	"They have been very lucky because The Pirate Bay verdict came at the same time as the start of the election campaign, but I think The Pirate Party had the potential to grow anyway," a political scientist at Gothenburg University, Ulf Bjereld, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	10	1652	1862	"The Pirate Party has taken advantage of a new cleavage in Swedish politics, about civil liberties, about who should have the right to decide over knowledge, and that's not a left-right cleavage," Bjereld said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	11	1872	1993	"The traditional parties have been sleeping, they have underestimated the political potential in these issues," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	12	2003	2182	The European parliament election, with little at stake in Sweden and a low turnout expected, is considered the perfect opportunity for an election sensation, according to experts.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	14	2286	2410	If you could have a (unique) profile there, it's easier to succeed," said Toivo Sjoeren, head of the Sifo polling institute. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	15	2420	2486	The typical Pirate Party supporter is a young, male Internet buff. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	16	2496	2679	According to Sifo, some 13 percent of people under 30 plan to vote for the party, compared to seven percent of those aged 30 to 49, and only three percent of those over the age of 49. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	17	2689	2782	The party garners some 10.5 percent support among male voters, but only 1.5 percent of women. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	18	2792	2911	"It's a 'geek' party," admitted Brian Levinsen, a 31-year-old member, attending a recent campaign meeting in Stockholm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	19	2921	3027	"We use Twitter, Skype, we use blogs," explained Jan Lindgren, the party's campaign director in Stockholm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	20	3037	3134	"There is always someone (from the party) online, even at 2:00 or 4:00 in the morning," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	21	3144	3292	Many members say they joined not only because they are die-hard fans of the Internet and filesharing, but because they fear a "Big Brother" society. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	22	3302	3362	"Sweden was built on protecting the freedom of its citizens. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	23	3363	3409	This pact is now disappearing," said Levinsen.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	1	160	354	The outfits are still elegant, the heels still vertiginous, but Rachida Dati's flashing smile seems just a little more forced since she found out she was being exiled to the European parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	2	364	542	For the 42-year-old Dati, a virtually guaranteed victory in the EU election is seen as proof of the justice minister's dramatic fall from President Nicolas Sarkozy's good graces. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	3	552	745	Once her seat in the EU parliament is confirmed after France's vote on June 7, Dati, the first French minister from North African immigrant stock, will have to resign from Sarkozy's government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	4	755	936	"I had the immense honour of being the justice minister, so I'm not going to be bitter about it," Dati said in a television interview, warning: "They won't get rid of me like that!" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	5	946	1124	Having risen to power as Sarkozy's devoted aide, she will now have to launch into electoral politics away from her natural habitat in the glittering salons of the Parisian elite. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	6	1134	1275	Mocked by opponents as a lightweight, Dati was all steel and seriousness at a recent electoral meeting in a well-heeled western Paris suburb. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	7	1285	1472	She replied with poise to questions from the crowd, many drawn to the event more by her celebrity status and reputation for gaffes than by enthusiasm for the European parliament election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	8	1482	1564	"Rachida Dati lacks neither skill nor determination," said analyst Philippe Braud. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	9	1565	1586	"She can bounce back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	10	1587	1697	She has political trump cards: she represents ethnic diversity, she's a fighter and she fascinates the media." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	11	1707	1896	Dati, a lawyer by training who became an advisor and spokeswoman for Sarkozy, was an outsider without political experience when he made her justice minister after his 2007 election triumph. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	12	1906	2046	Dati, with her rags to riches background, and other surprise female picks added energy to the line up, and Sarkozy was visibly proud of her. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	13	2056	2280	She threw herself into an ambitious programme to reform the French legal system, closely following promises made by the president, but antagonised a generation of magistrates and ministerial aides with her domineering style. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	14	2290	2477	A close friend of Sarkozy's second wife, Cecilia, she became a regular feature in celebrity magazines and gossip columns, gaining a reputation for her couture outfits and jet set parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	15	2487	2700	Eyebrows were also raised when the government was forced to confirm that the justice ministry had overspent its 200,000-euro (272,000-dollar) annual entertainment budget after she hosted several luxury receptions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	16	2710	2897	Concerned that his protegee needed a power base of her own, Sarkozy had her parachuted into Paris' 7th district as mayor, and began to push for her to take on a more party political role. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	17	2907	3097	But Dati's star slipped as magistrates demonstrated against her bid to streamline the court system and jail wardens against conditions said to have contributed to a spate of prison suicides. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	18	3107	3143	Meanwhile, other changes were afoot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	19	3144	3264	Nicolas and Cecilia Sarkozy divorced and Dati has never been as close to his third wife, former super model Carla Bruni. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	20	3274	3334	Dati's private life is also, in her own term, "complicated". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	21	3335	3383	In January, she gave birth to a daughter, Zohra. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	22	3384	3485	Her refusal to name the child's father has triggered a whirl of media speculation about his identity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	23	3495	3701	She rushed back to work five days later, earning praise from some quarters as a role model for career women, but brickbats from those who thought her haste undermined the fight for generous maternity leave. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	24	3711	3901	Nevertheless, despite Dati's display of unruffled commitment to his cause, Sarkozy took personal charge of the judicial reform agenda, in an early sign that he was tiring of his former ally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	25	3911	4105	Rather than sack her and call into question his own judgment in picking her, Sarkozy set about strong-arming her into the European campaign, which she had previously said she had no interest in. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	26	4115	4273	The race began badly when a video of her giggling inanely and failing to answer questions on European policy at a youth event made the rounds of the Internet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	27	4274	4343	She has since showed more determination and ambition in the campaign.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	2	387	630	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	3	640	855	The two said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	4	865	1109	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy who still called for "real European regulation" to tackle the financial crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	5	1119	1301	They said first steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the EU summit in June.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	6	1054	1093	"It was not in accordance with the law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	7	1094	1246	She said it was unjust bullying," added Nyan Win, who is both the spokesman for her National League for Democracy party and also part of her legal team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	8	1256	1446	Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May 6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers and spending two nights there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	9	1447	1467	He is also on trial. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	10	1477	1672	Critics say Myanmar's military regime has trumped up the charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	11	1682	1822	Nyan Win said that despite the apparently unfortunate timing of the incident, Aung San Suu Kyi did not harbour hard feelings against Yettaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	12	1832	1903	"She also said she has no grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	13	1913	2070	Aung San Suu Kyi told the trial last week that she had not violated her house arrest and that she had only offered Yettaw ""temporary shelter" as he was ill. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	14	2080	2266	She insisted that she could not be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	15	2276	2490	But Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security forum in Singapore on Sunday that Aung San Suu Kyi had "committed a cover-up of the truth" by failing to report Yettaw's visit in May.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	1	178	357	The Sri Lankan military is probing the possibility that the Tamil Tiger's spy chief may still be alive, despite testimony that he was killed with the rest of the rebel leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	2	367	558	"The military is still investigating Tiger intelligence wing leader Pottu Amman's death as they could not find his body among the top level Tiger leaders," the state-run Sunday Observer said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	3	568	792	Amman was seen as the number two in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hierarchy after rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and was believed to have masterminded the 1991 assassination of Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	4	802	1016	The newspaper, which reflects government policy, said the military had testimony from a surrendered Tiger cadre who claimed that the spy leader had been killed before the final battle in which Prabhakaran perished. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	5	1026	1058	However, no body was ever found. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	6	1068	1229	Amman is the subject of an international arrest warrant for the Gandhi slaying as well as the 1996 bombing of the Sri Lankan Central Bank which killed 91 people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	7	1239	1476	The Observer said the military could not confirm the deaths of Prabhakaran's wife, Mathiwathini, and their daughter, Dwarka, although they were suspected to have been in the same area during the final military offensive against the LTTE. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	8	1486	1621	The military on Thursday identified Prabhakaran's parents, who had sought shelter with security forces after fleeing the conflict zone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	9	1631	1696	Government troops announced the defeat of the LTTE two weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	10	1706	1892	Ethnic Tamils displaced by the fighting are now being held in camps ringed by barbed wire and security forces, who say they need to weed out former rebel fighters disguised as civilians.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0380	1	187	369	Iranian security officials have defused a handmade bomb on board a domestic flight headed from Ahvaz, in the west of Iran, to the capital Tehran, Fars news agency reported on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0380	2	379	529	"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0380	3	530	603	"The plane landed immediately in Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0380	4	613	708	Ahvaz is the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, which borders on Iraq and the Gulf.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	0	58	107	Student bashings strain Australia-India relations 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	1	184	378	Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained diplomatic relations with New Delhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	2	388	619	What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has spiralled into a crisis that prompted Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to call his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh last week to assure him about student safety. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	3	629	847	The students are demanding action after more than 70 assaults on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past fortnight, and there has been prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	4	857	1029	Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across newspapers in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	5	1030	1080	A teenager has been charged with attempted murder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	6	1090	1239	"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	7	1249	1418	Another student, Baljinder Singh, told Australian public radio last week how his attackers laughed as he pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train station. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	8	1428	1651	"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound to his stomach and advised Indians to stay away from Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	9	1661	1885	Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", picking up on a term reportedly used by some of the youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western suburbs, where police say 30 percent of assault victims are Indian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	10	1895	2036	It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million people where the Indian student population numbers less than 50,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	11	2046	2267	Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late at night with items such as mobile phones and portable MP3 players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	12	2277	2428	But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said last week that racism was playing a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	13	2438	2634	Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more than a thousand supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police attitude had frustrated many students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	14	2644	2781	Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	15	2791	2967	While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children studying in Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	16	2977	3153	That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000 Indians to the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	17	3163	3344	More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is sustaining long-term damage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	18	3354	3504	A string of government ministers have made statements recently emphasising the country's multi-cultural society and relatively low levels of violence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	19	3514	3786	"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told commercial television Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	20	3796	3916	The assault on Theerthala proved the catalyst, High Commissioner Singh describing it as a particularly distressing case. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	21	3926	4075	It sparked a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public statements from Indian officials that indicated they had run out of patience. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	22	4085	4140	"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," Singh said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	1	170	334	Writer and poet Kamala Das, known for her frank discussion of female sexuality in conservative India, died in hospital on Sunday, the Press Trust of India reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	2	335	346	She was 75. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	3	356	463	Das died in the western city of Pune after a long illness, PTI said, without specifying the cause of death. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	4	473	621	Das was born into a family of writers and wrote poems and short stories in English and Malayalam, the language of her southern home state of Kerala. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	5	631	843	She was one of the first Indian writers to explore sexual themes in her work, and her 1976 autobiography, My Story, was a candid recollection of her own sexual coming of age that was translated into 15 languages.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	1	190	372	Ailing General Motors moved closer Sunday to its expected bankruptcy filing as company bondholders approved a  government-sponsored debt for equity deal, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	2	382	551	The bondholders had until 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) Saturday to indicate whether they supported the group's new offer ahead of the once mighty corporation's looming bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	3	561	688	The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	4	698	909	Citing "people briefed on the matter," the newspaper said the bondholders with slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt agreed to support the plan by the government-set deadline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	5	919	1041	Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of GM’s outstanding bonds, The Times said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	6	1051	1112	No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	7	1122	1234	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	8	1235	1357	They would also control 25 percent of the "new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	9	1367	1534	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	1	193	370	Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for support in dismantling the Tamil Tigers' international support network after declaring victory over the rebels following the decades-long conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	2	380	565	Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in Singapore that the global organisation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) remained "largely intact." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	3	575	718	"Many of the operatives have clearly cultivated powerful, political lobbies in certain capitals with a view to resurrecting the LTTE," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	4	728	1018	"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist the government of Sri Lanka to track down the global network of the LTTE," he told an annual forum of defence and military officials organised by the London- based International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	5	1028	1283	Sri Lanka's military claimed complete victory over the separatist Tamil Tigers after wiping out the guerrillas' leadership nearly two weeks ago, but has been dogged by accusations that thousands of civilians were killed in the final weeks of the campaign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	6	1293	1390	The LTTE launched a campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the Sinhalese-majority island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	7	1391	1437	Much of its funding came from Tamils overseas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	8	1447	1609	Bogollagama dismissed allegations that heavy weapons were used by the military in civilian areas as part of the "propaganda of genocide against the Tamil people." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	9	1619	1802	"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of Sri Lanka," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	10	1812	2115	"Sri Lanka will no doubt enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism, whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	11	2125	2242	"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all," the foreign minister said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	12	2252	2413	Sri Lanka's handling of the LTTE "has sent a strong signal to the international community that terror can be defeated and terrorism can be eliminated," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	13	2423	2677	Amnesty International called Saturday for an independent probe into the number of civilians killed following a report in London's Times newspaper citing confidential UN reports that said more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Sri Lankan army shelling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	14	2687	2871	Sri Lanka's Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has dismissed Amnesty's call and said the organisation was being "ridiculous to keep harping on things they cannot substantiate."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	1	188	355	Haitian-born American Andre Berto retained his World Boxing Council welterweight title Saturday with a lopsided unanimous 12-round decision over Colombian Juan Urango. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	2	365	458	Two judges scored the bout 118-110 for the Florida-based Berto, while a third saw it 117-111. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	3	468	552	Berto remained unbeaten in 25 professional fights, with 19 wins inside the distance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	4	562	682	Urango was frustrated by the nimble Berto, who kept his distance and scored to the head with the jab and with his right. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	5	692	781	Urango' best round was the fourth, when he landed a series of lefts to the head and body. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	6	791	969	But Berto largely avoided Urango's pressure, givig him little opportunity to get inside in the middle rounds while connecting himself with shots to Urango's head with both hands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	7	979	1082	After a lackluster ninth round drew jeers from the crowd, Berto stepped it up in the last three rounds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	8	1092	1268	Urango, who fell to 21-2-1 with 16 wins inside the distance, will now return to the super lightweight ranks, where he is still the International Boxing Federation title holder.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	1	170	362	Taliban rebels in Pakistan are taking their war to the cities, honing terror tactics to maximise civilian carnage after suffering heavy losses in a blistering military offensive, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	2	372	589	Pakistan has been rocked by 14 bomb blasts that have killed more than 80 people in urban areas since it launched a determined air and ground assault against the Taliban in pockets of the northwest at the end of April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	3	599	810	The military said on Saturday that troops had regained control of the main town of Mingora in Swat valley from the Taliban, in what is being touted as a significant milestone in the month-long ongoing offensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	4	820	1046	But the rebels, who Washington fears threaten Pakistan's very existence, are striking back in cities like the regional capital Peshawar, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Mingora and previously shielded from major attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	5	1056	1221	"They are taking this war to the cities, hoping to build up enough pressure on the government to halt the military activity," security analyst Hasan Askari told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	6	1231	1383	"The Taliban challenge now threatens routine life and commercial activity in cities... allied extremist groups are facilitating their agenda," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	7	1393	1560	Attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, analysts say, executing commando-style assaults armed with suicide vests, vehicle bombs, guns, grenades and rockets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	8	1570	1761	Over the last two weeks in Peshawar, bombs have exploded outside a cinema, near crowded electronics shops, at a police checkpoint and even alongside a bus full of children with special needs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	9	1771	1968	And in Lahore, Pakistan's entertainment capital, a bomb, gun and grenade assault killed 24 people and partially damaged the provincial headquarters of the country's premier spy agency on Wednesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	10	1978	2124	It was the third spectacular assault in and around the eastern city -- hundreds of miles from the offensive in the northwest -- in as many months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	11	2134	2309	The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) militant group claimed responsibility, telling people in a statement they should get out of the cities because there will be more violence to come. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	12	2319	2543	Newspaper columnist Shafqat Mehmood said the Taliban, who want to enforce sharia law, are becoming more and more desperate in the face of the military onslaught in the northwest, which the army says has claimed 1,200 rebels.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	15	2700	2834	While the government could do more to protect key targets, he said, underfunded and overstretched security forces can only do so much. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	16	2844	2902	"It is difficult to patrol markets and streets," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	17	2912	3036	"Our province is facing a war-like situation," the police chief of North West Frontier Province, Malik Naved Khan, told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	23	3741	3907	Echoing Hasan Askari, he added the Taliban will likely have willing allies from a catalogue of banned radical groups that traditionally have battled India in Kashmir. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	24	3917	4099	These include Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Yusufzai said, an extremist element linked to Al-Qaeda, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, accused of carrying out the Mumbai attacks last year that left 166 dead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	25	4109	4207	"These extremist outfits and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) have a relationship that runs in their blood.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	3	328	474	The 25-year-old American is the founder of Wordpress, software that allows computer users worldwide to easily create their own websites, or blogs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	4	484	742	The simplicity of Wordpress has made it one of the world's top blogging platforms six years after it was set up, its adherents ranging from knitting fanatics (jessinohio.wordpress.com) to CNN's resident doctor Sanjay Gupta (pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/site). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	5	752	856	But in 2006, as the site was growing from strength to strength, Chinese authorities suddenly blocked it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	6	866	998	Overnight, one million Chinese visitors to the various blogs disappeared, accounting for about a quarter of all traffic to the site. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	7	1008	1201	"I wish there was a better story, but really it just went away one day and we didn't know what to do about it," Mullenweg told AFP, during a visit to Hong Kong to speak to some of his bloggers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	8	1211	1410	After some discussions, Mullenweg realised the site would be allowed back online if he agreed to block certain words or topics and give up information to the Chinese communist government about users.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	11	1587	1735	The site remains blocked, although Mullenweg, unable to suppress a giggle, points out that the official Chinese line insists it is freely available. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	12	1745	2008	His decision not to pander to China contrasts sharply with other companies that have agreed to the country's extensive Internet controls -- often dubbed the Great Firewall of China -- in the hope of gaining access to what is now the world's biggest online market.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	18	2669	2876	That's just the kind of technology-inspired rebellion that appeals to Mullenweg, who has also refused to submit to similar government demands in Turkey, and whose instinct is to make things freely-available.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	1	191	447	Seven years after being catapulted to fame and fortune with her hit comedy "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", Nia Vardalos makes a long-awaited return to the big screen this month with another film that takes the Canadian-born actress back to her ancestral roots. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	2	457	686	Vardalos, 46, became an overnight success in 2002, when the romantic comedy she wrote and starred in went on to become a monster hit, earning more than 350 million dollars worldwide after being made for only five million dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	3	696	869	The success of the film -- which also earned Vardalos a best original screenplay nomination at the Oscars -- allowed Vardalos to take her time deciding her next career move. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	4	879	1098	Although she starred in a short-lived television spin-off of "Greek Wedding", Vardalos has been largely inactive since 2002 preferring to focus on starting a family before relaunching her career with "My Life in Ruins." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	5	1108	1277	Her new film, which goes on release in North America on June 5, sees her play a Greek-American history professor who returns to Greece to work as a tour guide in Athens. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	6	1287	1497	Vardalos said the script for the film, which includes several scenes shot at the Acropolis and other historic sites, had fired her enthusiasm after years out of the spotlight as she attempted to start a family. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	7	1507	1710	"When we got the permission to shoot this film, it was so exciting and it was the first that I had found something where I wanted to be on camera in for a long time," she told reporters in Beverly Hills. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	8	1720	1937	"In 2004, I had come to the end of a 10-year infertility battle and I just chose to privately deal with it, so I stepped back out of acting," said Vardalos, who recently adopted a three-year-old girl with her husband. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	9	1947	2066	"I was really happy to be offered a nice clean script that celebrates Greece and is a love letter to Greece," she adds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	10	2076	2275	Vardalos says that despite the commercial success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", her business relationships with her producers, who include actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, have not changed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	11	2285	2393	"The good news is that you strive for what happened with my first movie for your whole life," Vardalos said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	12	2394	2464	"And so it happened and its like, 'oh that's over, the rest is gravy.' 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	13	2474	2536	"The greater news is that my producers are the same producers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	14	2537	2609	They treated me like gold before 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' made a dime. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	15	2610	2700	And they don't expect anything from me, except let's have fun and let's tell fun stories."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	17	2797	2960	But she says she has resisted the temptation to try and regurgitate the formula from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" in an attempt to score another commercial bullseye. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	18	2970	3044	"I write little movies and then the rest is up to the audience," she said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	1	208	460	The ancient mystery shrouding Lalibela, Ethiopia's revered medieval rock-hewn churches, could be lifted by a group of French researchers given the go-ahead for the first comprehensive study of this world heritage site legend says was "built by angels". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	2	470	651	The team will have full access to the network of 10 Orthodox chapels chiseled out of volcanic rock -- some standing 15 metres (42 feet) high -- in the mountainous heart of Ethiopia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	3	661	840	Local lore holds they were built in less than 25 years by their namesake, the 13th-century King Lalibela, with the help of angels after God ordered him to erect a "New Jerusalem". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	4	850	948	The monolithic structures are located 500 kilometres (300 miles) north of the capital Addis Ababa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	5	949	1111	Long a holy pilgrimage site in a land proud of its Christian Orthodox heritage, they are also a travel draw in a poverty-stricken country hoping to boost tourism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	6	1121	1309	The multidisciplinary team of historians, archaeologists, topographers and a specialist in liturgy will spend several weeks probing the subterranean complex to try to identify its origins. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	7	1319	1435	Historian Marie Laure Derat, with the French Centre for Ethiopian Studies (CFEE), said "there are several theories". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	8	1436	1591	In one, "an Egyptian patriarch was believed to be the source of these structures, another says the 13th-century King Lalibela built the site from scratch." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	9	1601	1705	"During the day the king would work with Ethiopian artisans and at night he would 'be helped by angels'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	10	1706	1848	Some even cite a key role by the Knights Templar," she said, referring to one of the key Western Christian military orders of the Middle Ages. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	11	1858	2004	Though earlier studies have been carried out, they were generally by lone researchers with restricted access who studied mainly church interiors . 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	12	2014	2245	Derat said the heretofore reluctant Orthodox church gave the French team carte blanche to probe "the entire site, not just the churches, to understand how the periods overlap and to read history in this open book that is Lalibela". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	13	2255	2376	Funded by the French government and Ethiopian Airlines, the team is already certain the chapels were not built in one go. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	14	2386	2574	Research chief Francois Xavier Fauvelle said three distinct periods have been identified in the maze of deep tunnels, passageways and chapels, some of which resemble ancient Greek temples. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	15	2584	2667	"There was originally a basalt dome under which we found evidence of cave dwellers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	16	2668	2842	Then there was the construction of a fortress with trenches, a perimetre wall and underground tunnels," he said pointing to rocks he said where once part of the defence wall. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	17	2852	3090	"The third period was established thanks to an enormous mound of earth about 20 metres high that came from the excavation of the church of Gabriel Ruphael," he said, referring to the chapel some believe was once King Lalibela's residence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	18	3100	3269	"The Ruphael Gabriel church was probably part of the fortress and was turned into a church: the facade was extended, windows opened and a chapel dug out," said Fauvelle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	19	3279	3472	UNESCO added Lalibela to its world heritage list in 1978, a boon for tourism efforts in this country of 85 million where poverty is rampant and agriculture accounts for nearly half the economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	20	3473	3527	Visitors can already join organized tours of the site. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	21	3537	3689	But the bid to shed light on its origins has not shaken the Orthodox clergy and faithful here, who contend that Lalibela arose with divine intervention. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	22	3699	3871	"It is God through his angels who made these churches," said Alebachew Reta, spokesman for the Lalibela clergy who insisted "the 10 churches were created in just 24 years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	23	3881	3962	"You can observe that even one would be difficult to build in that space of time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	24	3963	4002	So for us it is God's work," said Reta. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	25	4003	4080	"For the one who created mankind, building these churches was not difficult."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	1	208	339	The world outcry over Israeli settlements in the West Bank is absurd since God gave this land to the Jews, says Rabbi Yaakov Savir. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	2	340	393	The Arabs, he says, should make their home elsewhere. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	3	403	643	"This territory is Jewish territory," says Savir, a settler who runs a religious school in the Havat Gilad outpost which consists of little more than a few tin huts and weather-worn trailers, some horses and chickens and several car wrecks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	4	653	866	"This is our home," he says, making a sweeping gesture towards the Jewish settlements that dominate nearby hilltops to show he means the entire West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day-War. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	5	876	1031	Havat Gilad, which 20 families call home, is a wildcat outpost, meaning that unlike full-scale settlements, it is not authorised by the Israeli government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	6	1041	1181	The international community considers all settlements illegal, and the issue is one of the thorniest in peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	7	1191	1310	With US pressure mounting, Israel could soon make good on its years-old pledge to tear down a couple of dozen outposts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	8	1320	1373	In Havat Gilad's case, it wouldn't be the first time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	9	1383	1624	Built by Moshe Zar, a former member of a Jewish underground movement that planted bombs in the cars of Arab mayors, the outpost was torn down by the Israeli authorities barely hours after a group of teenagers pitched the first tents in 2002. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	10	1625	1657	Rebuilding started the next day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	11	1667	1792	Savir is outraged the government of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would even consider bulldozing Jewish homes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	12	1802	2073	"Jewish people live here by Biblical right," he claims, standing in the trailer that houses the religious school, surrounded by students who sport the look favoured by ideologically motivated religious settlers -- long locks, knitted skullcap, loose clothing and sandals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	13	2083	2202	Savir insists he has nothing against Arabs -- he won't speak of Palestinians other than to say there is no such people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	14	2212	2276	"If Arabs want to stay, we won't kill them, we won't expel them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	15	2286	2374	"They are the ones who want to kill us, who don't want us to live in our home," he says. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	16	2384	2437	"Arabs," he adds "should find another place to live." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	17	2447	2601	The vast majority of the 280,000 Jews who live in the 120 West Bank settlements which Israel considers legal, have moved to the area for economic reasons. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	18	2602	2740	But the hardliners who share Savir's views that Jewish people have a God-given right to the land are extremely vocal and at times violent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	19	2750	2881	Rabbi Savir is convinced the residents of Havat Gilad, like others in similar outposts, "will certainly fight for every millimeter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	20	2882	2910	No one will leave his home." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	21	2920	3052	Israel agreed in 2003 to freeze all settlement activity and raze wildcat outposts but has not followed through on those commitments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	22	3062	3293	Outposts, typically located a few hundred metres (yards) from government- authorised settlements, include anything from a few shacks to communities of several dozen semi-permanent homes connected to the electricity and water grids. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	23	3303	3481	Many of the 100 or so outposts were built on West Bank hills by militant teenagers, known as "hilltop youths," with the aim of planting the seeds of new full-fledged settlements. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	24	3491	3692	A 2005 government-commissioned report said that in some cases officials authorised seizure of private Palestinian land to create outposts, and facilitated their connection to the water and power mains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	25	3702	3870	Palestinians see the outposts as part of a land grab and a scheme to further consolidate Israel's control over the West Bank, which is home to 2.4 million Palestinians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	26	3880	4120	Faced with mounting pressure from within his right-wing coalition on the one hand and the United States on the other, Netanyahu has vowed to continue building in existing settlement blocs while indicating he will dismantle wildcat outposts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	27	4130	4171	But he has failed to placate either side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	28	4181	4344	The premier has faced fierce criticism from the right for his willingness to tear down Jewish homes, and some blunt talk from Washington over settlement expansion. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	29	4354	4477	US President Barack Obama told Netanyahu during May 18 White House talks he wants a complete freeze of settlement activity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	30	4487	4619	"Not some settlements, not outposts, not natural growth exceptions," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, explaining the demand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	31	4629	4811	Israeli police did tear down Maoz Esther, north of the West Bank political capital of Ramallah, on May 21, but the move was dismissed by Israeli media as a meaningless token gesture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	32	4812	4871	The outpost consisted of just seven tin and plywood shacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	33	4881	5024	One week after the demolition, one house had already been rebuilt and another was being constructed without any hindrance from the authorities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	34	5034	5256	"We must settle here, God has ordered us to live on this land," says Daniel Landesberg, 20, as he and a group of teenagers spread out cement being poured out of a large concrete mixer truck to form the base of a new house. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	35	5266	5350	Landesberg is a firm believer in the "doubling" tactic adopted by hardline settlers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	36	5360	5425	"They tore down seven homes, we will build 14," he says, smiling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	37	5435	5459	And if the 14 are razed? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	38	5460	5490	"We'll build twice that many."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	1	164	278	GM's overall future may look grim, but half a world away from Detroit in Shanghai, business has never been better. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	2	288	405	The US auto giant is beating sales records in China and may soon be exporting Chinese-made cars to the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	3	415	461	"I don't think it makes much difference to us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	4	462	624	Obviously we'd prefer to have this restructuring done outside the courts," Kevin Wale, GM China's president and managing director, told AFP in a recent interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	5	634	740	"We operate as independent joint ventures here in China so we would continue pretty much as we are today." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	6	750	969	While GM pares back at home, it may add a plant in China to meet its goal of doubling annual sales to two million within five years with products developed for "the most important growth market in the world", Wale said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	7	979	1179	That extra capacity could also help produce GM cars which for the first time would be exported from China to the United States, under a proposal the automaker has reportedly submitted to US lawmakers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	8	1189	1406	GM has proposed shipping 17,335 Chinese-made cars to the US in 2011 and increasing that to 51,546 by 2014 -- representing 1.6 percent of its forecast 3.1 million cars five years from now, the Automotive News reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	9	1416	1656	China led the world in auto sales in April, and GM China's joint ventures led the pack, with sales rising 29.9 percent on year to 151,084 vehicles, driven by demand for Buicks and small Wuling "bread vans" that cost less than 5,000 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	10	1666	1818	"It's definitely one of the market leaders here -- in drastic contrast to their performance in the US," said Shen Jun, an auto analyst at Roland Berger. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	11	1828	1938	GM's first Shanghai sales office opened in 1929, boasting: "Buick owners are mostly the leading men in China." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	12	1948	2046	Pu Yi, the last emperor, revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen and premier Zhou Enlai all owned Buicks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	13	2056	2175	But that history is barely known, allowing GM to recast Buick as a car for China's young and fast-growing middle class. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	14	2185	2378	"Volkswagen has good prices and good quality, but their cars look very average, not unique," said Li Pengxiang, a 29-year-old telecoms project manager, referring to China's number two carmaker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	15	2388	2445	"These new (GM) models look fresh and suit young people." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	16	2455	2681	GM has earned a reputation for savvy marketing with moves like enlisting "Prison Break" star Wentworth Miller -- a top celebrity in China despite the show never airing here legally -- to star in its latest campaign, Shen said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	17	2691	2913	"They think they are doing much better than the parent company in the US," he said, saying GM's success in China boils down to smart decisions, good timing and luck that has put it far ahead of US rivals Ford and Chrysler. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	18	2923	3152	GM teamed with China's largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Group or SAIC, in 1997 -- foreign carmakers here need a local joint venture partner -- after SAIC rejected Toyota and before Ford could sign a deal, Shen said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	19	3162	3341	Tension among joint venture partners is common, but GM and SAIC are known to have unrivalled chemistry, according to Zhu Junyi, an auto analyst at the Shanghai Information Centre. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	20	3351	3459	GM spends heavily on research and development while delegating key responsibilities to its partner, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	21	3469	3563	"German and Japanese investors are more reluctant to give away any leadership role," Zhu said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	22	3564	3609	"GM has done a better job with localisation." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	23	3619	3783	GM's growing sales are impressive but competitors are growing faster -- Hyundai shot up 74 percent on year last month while Nissan sales grew 55 percent, Shen said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	24	3793	3928	Even as the Chinese market's growth slows -- to eight percent in 2008 after years of double digit growth -- more players are piling in. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	25	3938	4058	"The Japanese automakers are steamrolling China's auto market," said Eric Xu, head of Timer-Auto Consulting in Shanghai. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	0	58	110	GM's collapse will mark end of a blue collar dynasty 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	1	195	389	The expected collapse of General Motors will mark the death of a blue collar dynasty which bestowed upon generations of Americans the security of a job for life and a ticket to the middle class. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	2	399	501	"GM represented the good life," said Gary Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	3	511	640	"There was a social contract: you worked hard and the company would reward you with job security and good pay," Chaison told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	4	641	698	"And this was something you could pass on (to your kids.)

AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	12	1798	1983	GM was a giant in its chrome-detailed heyday, employing more than 600,000 people worldwide and 464,000 in the United States back in 1962 when it sold more than half the cars in America. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	13	1993	2195	Founded in 1908, GM grew to be the largest private US employer, the world's biggest company, had revenues higher than the gross domestic product of most nations, and currently operates in 140 countries.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	15	2425	2592	GM also helped expand the American middle class with the standard-setting high wages and solid benefit packages won by hundreds of thousands of unionized auto workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	16	2602	2677	The phrase "what's good for GM is good for the country" became commonplace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	17	2687	2816	"Between 1921 and 1980 they never lost money," said Sean McAlinden, chief economist at Michigan's Center for Automotive Research.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	23	3306	3464	Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda steadily gained market share first with the low cost of their vehicles and then with their reputation for higher quality. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	24	3474	3562	Plant closures became a part of the American motif and GM shed most of its subsidiaries. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	25	3572	3755	The Detroit Three were able to revive their fortunes in the 1990s with the development of sport utility vehicles and the rising popularity of trucks, but the profits were short-lived. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	26	3765	3930	Japanese automakers responded to Detroit's hulking truck-based suvs with smaller, more efficient car-based crossovers suvs and once again GM was slow to follow suit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	27	3940	4058	When fuel prices began to rise and consumers shifted away from gasoline guzzles, GM's sales -- and profits -- crashed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	28	4068	4138	The latest round of plant closures and layoffs began in November 2005.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	30	4282	4495	The real problem, analysts say, is that GM waited too long to address the ballooning "legacy costs" associated with supporting generations of retirees with a US market share that had slipped to 26 percent by 2005. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	31	4505	4619	GM's costs for each vehicle built were about 2,000 to 2,500 dollars higher than the US plants of its Asian rivals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	32	4629	4839	GM was able to reach a historic deal with the United Auto Workers union to slash labor costs in 2007, but only after spending 103 billion dollars to fund pensions and retiree health care from 1993 through 2007.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	2	369	576	With the US government expected to hold as much as 72.5 percent of the new firm that would emerge from bankruptcy, analysts say a big question is whether GM can concentrate on the difficult auto marketplace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	3	586	741	"The tricky part is to leave day-to-day management to the executives of the company," said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive at auto research firm Edmunds.com. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	4	751	926	For the government, he said, "the temptation is to influence product decisions based on political considerations instead of market considerations, and that's always a danger." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	5	936	1131	Anwyl said it is too soon to tell how the matter will be handled by the administration of President Barack Obama, which has pledged to get out of the business as soon as GM gets back on its feet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	6	1141	1346	David Cole, chairman of the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said the government officials "are smart, dedicated people, but they can't learn the key issues of this industry in a short time." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	7	1356	1504	Cole said the government can succeed if it focuses on the goal of restoring profitability, getting taxpayer money repaid and then getting out of GM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	8	1514	1634	"If the government forces a company to go out of step with the reality of the marketplace, that's a problem," Cole said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	9	1644	1735	"If you force the industry to build products they can't sell profitably, that's a problem." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	10	1745	1857	Cole said it was "almost unavoidable that the government will try to superimpose other agendas" on the carmaker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	11	1867	2121	Cole and Anwyl said it would be a mistake for the government to use its role as the financial backer of GM or Chrysler to push the firms into building certain types of cars to meet environmental or other goals because consumer demands can change quickly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	12	2131	2239	Anwyl said that with the current level of fuel prices, demand for small, fuel- efficient cars is decreasing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	13	2240	2384	He added the Obama administration's effort to further boost fuel efficiency may hurt efforts to help Detroit automakers become profitable again. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	14	2394	2593	Peter Cohan, a management consultant and faculty member at Babson College, said GM must keep a focus on "developing a line of products that can compete with Toyota, Nissan and the rest of the world." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	15	2603	2734	"I hope the government doesn't push GM to make hybrids just for the sake of doing it but because it will be profitable strategy ... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	16	2735	2841	They need to design and build a vehicle that will last longer than a Toyota with lower maintenance costs." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	17	2851	3017	Although some GM critics blame existing management for its woes, Anwyl said the carmaker's biggest problems stemmed from decisions made years or even decades earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	18	3027	3104	"These festered over the years and GM never really confronted them," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	19	3114	3327	The US government is expected to invest an additional 30 billion dollars to help GM on top of its 20 billion dollars in loans, with most of the funds being converted to the equity stake of as much as 72.5 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	20	3337	3489	The US stake could be reduced by a share given to the governments of Canada and Ontario province, expected to pitch in with around nine billion dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	21	3499	3647	John Pottow, a law professor and bankruptcy specialist at the University of Michigan, said the proposed ownership structure raises a lot of hackles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	22	3657	3741	"Everyone is terrified of government mandates as opposed to market forces," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	23	3742	3833	"But I take it as face value the government saying they want to be reluctant shareholders." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	24	3843	4014	GM vice chairman Robert Lutz said the administration is taking appropriate measures to help an industry vital to the US economy, and praised Obama's Automotive Task Force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	25	4024	4113	"Their prime goal is not to gain government control of the automobile industry," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	26	4123	4207	"They absolutely don't want that ... their number one goal is to make us successful. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	27	4208	4393	There finally is a realization that our country cannot remain economically strong and militarily strong and have a global impact if it’s not backed up by wealth-producing industries."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	1	168	220	General Motors' fall from grace is not yet complete. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	2	221	374	The firm's expected bankruptcy would spell its eviction from the Dow Jones coveted list of 30 top US companies, of which GM has been a pillar since 1925. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	3	384	595	Even if GM's court filing has not yet been inked, speculation is rife about which firm might take its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the former behemoth's share price tumbled 47 percent last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	4	605	727	GM's shares fell to 75 cents each on Friday, well below the one dollar minimum for listing on the New York-based exchange. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	5	737	814	It is a confluence of factors that means GM will suffer the same fate as AIG. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	6	815	946	In September, the insurance giant was removed from the Dow Jones index two days after its nationalization, replaced by Kraft Foods. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	7	956	1101	"Once a company files for bankruptcy protection it is disqualified from being one of the 30 Dow components," said Dow spokesperson Sybille Reitz. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	8	1111	1176	"We are aware of GM's situation and are taking steps accordingly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	9	1177	1223	We have been following the situation closely." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	10	1233	1376	There is great competition to replace GM on the venerable list, which has served as a bellwether for US business since it was launched in 1896. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	11	1386	1514	One solution could be to replace GM with its rival Ford -- which has so far managed to escape the crisis without government aid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	12	1524	1599	But Ford's share price is far from stellar, trading at around 5.75 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	13	1600	1740	According to John Ogg of 247wallst.com, that makes the firm -- which had previously been a member of the elite club -- an unlikely inductee. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	14	1750	1834	One of the more frequently cited names is that of Wall Street darling Goldman Sachs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	15	1844	1971	The investment giant should be one of the first to pay back government loans, thanks to a share price of more than 144 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	16	1981	2094	Nicholas Colas, head of investment strategy at the BNY ConvergEx Group, said that makes Goldman Sachs a favorite. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	17	2104	2152	It may also have been helped by AIG's departure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	18	2162	2326	During the AIG shakeout in September the Dow Jones group noted that the exit of one financial firm meant that that economically vital sector was under- represented. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	19	2336	2367	But there are other contenders. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	20	2368	2466	From the technology sector Apple, Google, Cisco and Oracle are mentioned as possible replacements. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	21	2476	2596	Google's candidature runs into the difficulty that its share price -- at over 400 dollars a piece -- may skew the index. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	22	2606	2676	And technology stocks are already well represented by heavyweight IBM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	23	2686	2740	A recent poll by CNBC has further muddied the picture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	24	2741	2807	The financial news provider asked customers who should replace GM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	25	2808	2861	The response was Abbott Labs, a pharmaceuticals firm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	26	2871	2919	From the biotech field, Monsanto is an outsider. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	27	2920	3046	Owen Patrick of Deutsche Bank pointed out that Monsanto was an important member of another index, the Standard and Poor's 500. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	28	3056	3211	"It is a little smaller in market cap," said BNY's Colas, "and not as well known, but its technology and competitive advantage would be unique in the Dow." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	29	3221	3309	If the GM change has been keenly anticipated, that is because change on the Dow is rare. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	30	3319	3456	Only six firms have come in this decade, with three in 2008 including Kraft -- Bank of America and Chevron replaced Altria and Honeywell.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	1	178	358	A power struggle in Malaysia's Islamic party will be put to the test in leadership polls this week which pit hardline clerics against young moderates who want to rebrand the party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	2	368	574	The Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS) has enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to deep public disillusionment with the Barisan Nasional coalition that has governed the multiracial country for half a century.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0418	1	189	344	Hong Kong police have charged two men over a plot to assassinate one of the city's leading pro-democracy campaigners Martin Lee, a spokeswoman said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0418	2	354	459	The two men -- aged 49 and 50 -- were due to appear in court on June 16, the police spokeswoman told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0418	3	469	641	The plot to kill Lee, a veteran activist and long-time critic of Beijing, was revealed on Saturday, but took place last summer during elections for Hong Kong's legislature.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	1	180	375	Described by inmates as a "hell" where beatings are common and disease is rife, Myanmar's Insein Prison, where Aung San Suu Kyi is on trial, is the brutal symbol of the ruling junta's repression. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	2	385	590	The Nobel laureate has spent the past three weeks incarcerated in a so-called "guest house" at the jail on the outskirts of Yangon while her trial takes place behind closed doors at the notorious compound.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	7	1051	1190	It's some kind of silent 'killing field,'" Bo Kyi, who spent seven years in the jail following a failed student uprising in 1988, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	8	1200	1335	Several political prisoners told of how they suffered bruising weeks-long interrogations at the hands of the junta's jailers at Insein. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	9	1345	1529	Bo Kyi said during one round of questioning he was whipped with a rubber cord as he lay on his stomach and counted 150 lashes before he lost consciousness and awoke in a solitary cell. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	10	1539	1671	He said he was then forced to assume different positions for hour-long periods while shackled in chains with a bar between his legs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	11	1681	1864	The heavily secured Insein is home to many of the 2,100 political prisoners which the United Nations says are held in Myanmar's prisons, often on spurious sentences of up to 60 years.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	15	2438	2640	Former prisoner Aung Myo Naing, who spent more than eight years there, said that each cell in Insein is 8 by 11 feet (2.5 by 3.5 metres), furnished with two bamboo mats and two uncovered toilet buckets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	16	2650	2832	"Insein Prison is a deadly torture camp," the 41-year-old said, describing one period of about 45 days when he was kept in solitary confinement and forbidden to read, write or bathe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	17	2842	3032	Past prisoners have described novel methods of communicating during these times, scratching messages to one another on cigarette filter papers and feeding them through holes in prison walls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	18	3042	3166	Inmates are given 15 minutes outside of the cell daily to shower, but they have no soap and no spare clothes to change into. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	19	3176	3381	Many prisoners are starving -- their rations of food consist of boiled water with a few sparse vegetables, fish paste and occasional rations of meat along with overcooked rice, while water is not purified. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	20	3391	3544	The conditions mean that diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B are rife, while joint pains, eyesight problems and mental illness are commonplace.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0420	8	1235	1307	Swine flu was first detected last month in the United States and Mexico.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0421	8	1334	1474	"Asian currencies should be unified into a common currency in the course of the region's forming a single economic zone," Nakagawa told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0421	9	1484	1592	He did not give a timeframe, saying it would largely depend on economic and political developments in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0421	10	1602	1812	Nakagawa said people must "take into account the possibility that the dollar might not function as the key currency any more in the medium and long term" as the world seeks a new order in the post-Cold War era. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0421	11	1822	1991	Until an Asian common currency emerges, he said, "the Japanese government should make efforts to have the 'Asia zone' use the yen, not the dollar, for trade settlements.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	3	586	763	In the latest move, police questioned the opposition trio, including two lawmakers, over speeches made in the campaign for a by-election in the island state of Penang on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	4	773	838	"This is definitely another step towards creating a police state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	5	839	976	It is clearly an abuse of power," said Lim Kit Siang from the Democratic Action Party, who was one of the lawmakers questioned by police. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	6	986	1204	"The Perak crisis is broadening into a national crisis of confidence where one government institution after another is suffering from a credibility crisis as they have been made to serve the premier's agenda," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	7	1214	1432	Perak has been in limbo since February when the state's sultan ordered the Pakatan Rakyat to cede its control of the state, which it won in elections last year, after defections disrupted the delicate balance of power. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0424	8	1442	1662	Lim said he was investigated for his criticisms of Prime Minister Najib Razak over the takeover while the two others were being investigated over that issue as well as comments linking Najib to a sensational murder case.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	1	190	367	India's economy is on the upswing with eyes now keenly focused on July's planned budget for new market-opening moves by the freshly re-elected Congress government, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	2	377	596	The country logged unexpectedly strong 5.8 percent growth in the final quarter to March 2009, against forecasts of 5.0 percent, figures late last week showed, prompting analysts to say the economy had turned the corner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	3	606	758	"We see a new growth cycle taking shape with the first stop seven percent and then eight percent," said Rajeev Malik, economist at Macquarie Securities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	4	768	873	India's economy expanded by 6.7 percent in the year to March 2009, down from nine percent a year earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	5	883	1110	But the country of nearly 1.2 billion people is performing far better than many others caught in the global slump, thanks to its vast, resilient domestic market, hefty government spending and aggressive rate cuts, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	6	1120	1347	Foreign capital is pouring back into India with the benchmark Sensex share index near a nine-month high of 14,625 following a spurt in May after the Congress party was swept back to power with its biggest seat haul in 18 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	7	1357	1509	The strong mandate allows the Congress to govern without the support of the communists who propped up the government in parliament during its last term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	8	1519	1733	Economists called the Congress win a "game changer" for the economy because it raises hopes of political stability for the next five years and the introduction of economic reforms that had been blocked by the Left. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	9	1743	1997	There has already been a flurry of announcements by new ministers promising such moves as loosening state-controlled fuel pump prices, which would help refinery profits, and cutting mobile call rates to propel India's explosively growing cellular sector. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	10	2007	2198	Economic growth is forecast at around six percent in the first half of the year and closer to seven percent in the second amid "green shoots" signs such as higher car sales and cement output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	11	2208	2264	Next year, economists expect expansion of eight percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	12	2274	2454	"We expect a pick-up in economic activity from lower borrowing costs and higher government spending which is feeding through the system," said Shubhada  Rao, economist at Yes Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	13	2464	2612	In another positive sign, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) announced Saturday a sharp upturn in business optimism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	14	2622	2839	Some 57 percent of 300 firms polled in the final quarter to March declared economic conditions were "moderately to substantially" better -- up from the nine percent in the previous quarter who reported an improvement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	15	2849	2977	"Companies are looking forward to a recovery on the basis of their order books and performance," FICCI economist Anjan Roy said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	16	2987	3207	Economists are now focused on the budget that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has promised to present in the first week of July to see what steps he will take to open up India's still relatively inward-looking economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	17	3217	3405	Mukherjee said last week the government would press ahead with some long stymied reforms "in the financial sector and real economy" to make it more competitive and draw foreign investment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	18	3415	3598	The government may privatise some state-owned firms and raise  foreign-ownership caps in insurance and aviation as well as possibly broadening overseas investment access in retailing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	19	3608	3855	But Mukherjee said his "top priority" was "reviving the growth momentum" and helping the poor and he would step up spending even if this meant scant progress in closing India's yawning fiscal deficit, which at 6.2 percent is at a seven- year peak. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	20	3865	3996	HSBC economist Robert Prior Wandesforde forecast no "big bang" reforms in a country where economic changes can provoke huge debate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	21	4006	4131	But "even if they (the government) do a few things, the multiplier effect will be quite significant," said Macquarie's Malik.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	4	627	831	Thanks to high oil prices and a peacetime construction frenzy, Angola has enjoyed annual double-digit growth since a 27-year civil war ended in 2002 to become one of the world's fastest growing economies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	5	841	1027	Growth is set to slow this year, but interest from international investors has not abated with a recent flurry of high profile trade delegations, all hoping to get a piece of the action. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	6	1037	1224	The government's response to falling commodity prices, which threaten public spending aimed at Angola's poor majority, is diversification into areas such as agriculture and manufacturing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	7	1234	1423	Until now, Angola's main foreign players have been Brazilian and Portuguese firms, and Chinese companies helped along by close ties and credit lines believed to exceed five billion dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	8	1433	1654	But along with visits from the United States, France and South Korea in the past month, there have also been business forums in Rome and Cairo and state visits by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to Germany and Portugal.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	12	2097	2276	"The amount of time it takes to get to Angola from the US, via Europe or via South Africa, has an impact on trade and the new flight will definitely be a catalyst for investment."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	16	2680	2871	There is already plenty of Asian investment in Angola, particularly from China which holds a number of key construction contracts, including four 2010 Africa Cup of Nations football stadiums. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	17	2881	3114	China's interest in Angola has aroused concern in the west, especially as a number of the loans have been oil backed, but Alex Vines, of the London-based think tank Chatham House, believes the Sino-Angolan relationship may be waning. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	18	3124	3245	"From a geo-strategic point of view, Angola wants to woo lots of different investment, not just from China," he told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	19	3255	3389	"And that's why we've seen Dos Santos making these high profile visits to Europe and these other trade trips being invited to Angola." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	20	3399	3613	Despite predicting a three-percent contraction in 2009, World Bank economist Ricardo Gazel said: "Angola's economy is still in a much better position than most and medium and long term, the prospects are very good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0426	21	3623	3779	"There is a lot of investment interest, particularly in the non-petroleum sector which is good for diversifying the economy and for the economy as a whole."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	1	179	346	Malaysian police are probing three opposition members for alleged sedition and slander against the prime minister, amid allegations of a mounting crackdown on dissent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	1	193	375	After months of gloom, Bordeaux wine traders are hoping the 2008 vintage will revive the market after steep price cuts and rave reviews from the world's most influential connoisseur. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	2	385	505	The southwestern French region's rarest wines are sold every spring as a futures commodity, 12 months prior to bottling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	3	506	584	With the world gripped by recession, many had been fearing financial disaster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	4	594	811	The futures sale only concerns a tiny percentage of the 800 million bottles the Bordeaux region produces annually, but the prices of the top 20 wines help determine the public perception of the quality of the vintage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	5	821	1038	This year, the big wine estates brought prices down sharply, opening the way for traders to target middle market wine drinkers after a period when the finest wines were priced for sale to only the richest speculators. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	6	1048	1243	As Patrick Bernard, owner of wine merchant powerhouse Millesima, explained: "If the top 20 wines double or triple their prices as they did in 2005, all of Bordeaux wine is perceived as expensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	7	1253	1358	"The first wine on the market was Angelus, one of those 20 wines, and they cut their price by 40 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	8	1359	1474	A few days later, the First Growths came out with a 45 percent decrease and then Yquem with a 65 percent decrease." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	9	1484	1556	Other premium wines were released at the same time to maintain momentum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	10	1557	1645	Leoville Barton dropped its ex-cellar price to 23 euros and sold out within a few hours. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	11	1655	1862	"It was much better than I expected," said Lilian Barton, co-owner of the legendary estates Chateaux Leoville Barton and Langoa Barton, and director of her family wine merchant, Les Vins Fins Anthony Barton. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	12	1872	2070	In addition to dropping their prices, the chateaux had hoped to demonstrate their independence from US wine critic Robert Parker, nicknamed the "Million Dollar Nose" for his influence on the market. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	13	2080	2282	Parker is a champion of Bordeaux's wines, but many in the industry feel that he wields too much power with his rankings, and three-quarters of the wines were put on sale before he had given his verdict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	14	2292	2358	The demonstration of defiance was only partly successful, at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	15	2368	2494	Several sources said that sales prior to the release of Parker's ratings, with the exception of a few star buys, were subdued. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	16	2495	2565	The tempo changed when Parker awarded the vintage spectacular ratings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	17	2575	2614	"The buyers went berserk," said Barton. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	18	2624	2720	Clients who had pleaded poverty in early April suddenly found the wherewithal to buy on futures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	19	2730	2943	Despite annoyance with the fickle importers, Barton, Anson, Bernard and others were relieved to see the return of traditional customers who had been pushed out of the market in recent years by skyrocketing prices. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	20	2953	3102	The vintage was very good and there was a dramatic drop in price -- buyers are stocking up for customers who buy wine to drink rather than to invest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	21	3112	3177	"This was the vintage to buy for the consumer," enthused Bernard. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	22	3187	3359	Unlike nearly all of the other 400 wine merchants, Millesima, with annual revenues of 52 million euros, sells directly to the consumer in 11 European countries and America. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	23	3369	3419	"Direct sales to European consumers has been good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	24	3420	3513	There's no currency problem and they haven't been able to afford it over the last few years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	25	3523	3717	Bernard will buy 35,000 cases this year, a 10 percent increase over last year even though most chateaux are offering customers only 80 percent of their usual allocations because of a small crop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	26	3727	3923	While the 2008 futures campaign is slowly drawing to a close, there is little doubt that for many it succeeded in resuscitating not only sales but the image of Bordeaux wine as a consumer product. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	27	3933	4115	Already merchants and winegrowers are looking forward to Vinexpo, the International Wine and Spirits Exhibition held from June 21 to 25, with 45,000 professionals expected to attend.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	1	192	387	The main eurozone interest rate is probably locked in at 1.0 percent for now, but credit flows remain weak and the European Central Bank will detail this week new ways to get money flowing again. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	2	397	615	The ECB will also release Thursday its latest staff forecasts for growth and inflation in the 16-nation bloc, with a downward revision likely for the former owing to a disastrous first quarter in its leading economies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	3	625	807	With interest rates most likely on hold for a while, "the focus has shifted to any developments regarding unconventional policies," said Capital Economics economist Jennifer McKeown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	4	817	1065	The ECB has already said it will buy 60 billion euros' (85 billion dollars') worth of covered, or collateralised, bonds, a move that should help restore cash flows in French, German and Spanish markets where such instruments are traded most widely. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	5	1075	1144	Details are expected after a meeting of the bank's governing council. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	6	1154	1377	But the amount corresponds to just 0.6 percent of the eurozone's gross domestic product, McKeown noted, whereas bolder moves by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are worth around 10 percent of their respective GDP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	7	1387	1584	It also remains to be seen whether the ECB will "sterilise" the purchases by issuing its own debt or selling other assets, or whether it will just print new money, a move that could fuel inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	8	1594	1800	The bank's priority is to keep inflation just below 2.0 percent, but it now faces the prospect of a broad-based fall in prices that could end in a deflationary spiral which could strangle economic activity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	9	1810	1999	If businesses and individuals become convinced that prices will fall further, they postpone purchases, causing production to fall and raising unemployment, which can depress prices further. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	10	2009	2233	Eurozone inflation hit a record low of zero in May, European Union statistics showed, and will likely turn negative in coming months owing to comparisons with the same period last year when oil prices spiked to record highs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	11	2243	2398	But UniCredit economist Marco Valli said: "We don't think the ECB will be overly impressed" by the development, which has been forecast for several months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	12	2408	2616	ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet has stressed that short term price volatility is not a factor in the bank's decisions, and with oil prices on the rise again, a deflationary episode is unlikely to last long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	13	2626	2753	"The recent strong rally in oil prices makes the inflation picture more uncertain than just a couple of weeks ago," Valli said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	14	2763	2847	"The central bank will continue to see the risk of deflation as very low," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	15	2857	3061	The ECB can also point to indications that the eurozone's first recession has probably passed its trough even though the European Commission still expects the economy to contract by 1.9 percent this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	16	3071	3193	That leaves the thorny problem of credit growth, which according to the bank's figures continued to slow sharply in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	17	3203	3345	"There is no easing in the very tight credit conditions that are facing companies and individuals," noted Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	18	3355	3530	"Tighter credit conditions are a serious handicap to recovery prospects in the eurozone," he said, and raise pressure on the ECB "to take additional 'non- standard' measures." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	19	3540	3729	Commerzbank analyst Rainer Guntermann felt "the ECB has not yet closed the door to more easing measures," but that an expansion of the already announced bond purchases in June was unlikely.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	2	366	578	But Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to support with taxpayers' money a Kremlin-backed rescue may come back to haunt her, and could fail to prevent Opel crashing and burning further down the road, experts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	3	588	635	"All this seems to rest on a very fragile base. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	4	636	766	Let's say there is a 60 or 70 percent chance that it won't work," Juergen Pieper, an automotive analyst at Metzler Bank, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	5	776	1000	In a mammoth effort over recent months climaxing in a frenzy of activity last week, the German government agreed in the early hours of Saturday morning to back a takeover of Opel by a consortium formed around Canada's Magna. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	6	1010	1109	Under the deal, GM would keep 35 percent of the company and Opel's workers would retain 10 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	7	1110	1222	Magna, which makes auto parts, would hold a 20 percent stake and state-owned Russian lender Sberbank 35 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	8	1232	1454	Government sources told AFP that Germany would act as guarantor for around three billion euros (4.2 billion dollars) worth of loans, and the government would also itself make an emergency loan of 1.5 billion euros to Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	9	1464	1650	Magna meanwhile, which until recently was relatively unknown outside the auto industry, has pledged to cough up 300 million euros to keep the cash-starved Opel alive in the coming weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	10	1660	1874	The Canadian firm, which thrashed out an eleventh-hour agreement with GM executives in a luxury Berlin hotel on Friday, has pledged to keep all Opel's German factories open and limit job cuts there to around 2,500. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	11	1884	2095	But across Europe as a whole, where GM employs some 50,000 people including 7,000 in Spain and 4,700 at Britain's Vauxhall, the picture may be less rosy with Magna saying it plans to lay off one in five workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	12	2105	2331	Last week Germany came under pressure from Britain and Belgium not to save German jobs at the expense of workers elsewhere, and on Saturday Britain's biggest trade union Unite voiced concern about the fate of Vauxhall workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	13	2341	2579	It was also unclear whether Magna's intention to start making Opel cars at a factory in Russia owned by precious metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska's GAZ automaker would mean some production will be taken away from plants in the European Union. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	14	2589	2738	Russian involvement also raises eyebrows because it strengthens the already strong business ties -- most notably in gas -- between Berlin and Moscow. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	15	2739	2804	Critics say that these ties make Germany too soft on the Kremlin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	16	2814	2919	For analysts, it was September's elections in Germany that helped win Merkel over to Russian involvement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	17	2929	3044	"Money doesn't smell at election time," said Andrew Wilson at the European Council of Foreign Relations think tank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	18	3054	3271	Magna and its Russian backers have their work cut out making the deal work, with Opel part of a global automotive industry that was already facing huge challenges even before the world economy hit the skids last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	19	3281	3466	Frank Schwope, an analyst at Germany's NordLB bank, predicted that the Canadian- Russian investors "will try everything, and then fail and Opel will be insolvent in two or three years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	20	3476	3652	Magna also has very little experience making cars -- unlike Fiat, which also wanted to snap up Opel but then got cold feet -- and the financial details of the deal are unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	21	3662	3725	Merkel admitted on Saturday that the road ahead is a rocky one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	22	3735	3851	"For Opel and Magna, the work is now just beginning and there are several difficulties still to overcome," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	23	3861	4075	But cynics say that for the chancellor and her partners in the governing coalition, even if Opel does end up collapsing further down the road, it is mission accomplished: Opel will not be issue in September's vote.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	1	180	353	General Ould Abdel Aziz, who toppled Mauritania's government last year, said that no deal was near on delaying a controversial election scheduled to be held later this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	2	363	622	Supporters of Ould Abdel Aziz and the opposition have been holding talks with international mediators in the Senegalese capital Dakar, with sources on Saturday on saying an accord was close on resolving the political deadlock in the northwest African country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	3	632	672	But Ould Abdel Aziz dismissed such talk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	4	682	844	"A group of criminals is spreading these rumours and lies because they recognise their inevitable defeat at elections," he said at a campaign meeting on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	5	854	934	Ould Abdel Aziz often calls supporters of the main opposition parties criminals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	6	944	1158	"We are not negotiating in Dakar with criminals and bandits but with the international community to ensure democracy and move forward on the path of change," he was quoted as saying by Mauritania's ANI news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	7	1168	1221	"The election is still planned for June 6," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	8	1231	1437	Ould Abdel Aziz quit the military in April to run for president, and is widely expected to win if the vote goes ahead as he doesn't have serious contenders due to the boycott by the main opposition parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	9	1447	1709	The intensive talks launched in Dakar on Thursday -- which include officials from the United Nations, African Union, European Union and Arab League -- have focused on postponing the election to allow the opposition to end its boycott and participate in the vote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	10	1719	1968	Under a five-page draft accord seen by AFP have Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was toppled in last August's coup, would formally resign as president after signing a decree to usher in a transitional period under a temporary government of national unity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	11	1978	2087	This government would update the electoral rolls and issue voting cards to the electorate ahead of elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	12	2097	2248	A general amnesty would be declared, including for politicians arrested by the military in the wake of the coup and subsequently accused of corruption.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	1	195	400	Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but little progress in treating colorectal cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	2	410	635	Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	3	645	786	The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	4	796	1002	Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth slow more than a control group treated with Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	5	1012	1108	More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or Avastin and Tarceva. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	6	1109	1302	Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8 months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	7	1312	1446	The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	8	1456	1700	"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said Miller. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	9	1710	1855	A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	10	1865	2029	Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	11	2039	2136	As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard chemotherapy sessions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	12	2146	2308	"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the research. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	13	2318	2567	"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients' lives," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	14	2577	2743	However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest type of cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	15	2753	3028	Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when compared to those not taking the drug. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	16	3038	3285	Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer surgery.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	1	187	373	A Malaysian Sikh family is demanding to be given the remains of their relative who Islamic authorities say had converted to Islam, in the latest "body snatching" case to hit the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	2	383	574	The family's lawyer said that religious authorities insisted Mohan Singh, a 41 -year-old art director who died of a heart attack last Monday, had died a Muslim -- a claim the family disputes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	3	584	759	His body has been kept at the mortuary of a government hospital in central Selangor state which has refused to release the remains to the family, lawyer Rajesh Kumar told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	4	769	915	"When he died, he was a practising Sikh, he never told anybody and nobody knew that he had converted to Islam, including family and close friends. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	5	916	998	His identification card to date stated that he is still a non-Muslim," Kumar said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	6	1008	1034	"The family is very upset. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	7	1035	1125	All they want is to claim the body and cremate him according to the Sikh rites," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	8	1135	1337	The lawyer said that the Islamic authorities claimed Mohan, who had directed some local films, had converted to Islam in 1992 and was seeking confirmation of his conversion from an Islamic sharia court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	9	1347	1560	"Our contention is that at the time of his death, he was still practising Sikhism and even when his mother died three years ago, he performed the last rites for the mother according to the Sikh faith," said Kumar. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	10	1570	1628	"He wouldn't be able to do so if he is a Muslim," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	11	1638	1835	Conversion rows, including "body-snatching" cases when Islamic authorities have battled with relatives over the remains of people whose religion is disputed, are common in Muslim-majority Malaysia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	12	1845	2021	The tussles have raised allegations that the country of 27 million people is being "Islamised" and that the rights of the ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities are being eroded.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	1	172	365	The Fiji military regime, in its latest crackdown, has targeted the most influential religious group in the Pacific island nation, ordering the Methodist Church to cancel its annual conference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	2	375	492	A joint statement issued by the military and police accused the church of trying to bring instability to the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	3	502	666	The crackdown follows information that "inciteful issues are going to be discussed at the conference", police spokeswoman Ema Mua confirmed to the FijiLive website. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	4	676	851	The statement said the Methodist Church could not hide its involvement in politics and part of the agenda for the August conference focused on the current political situation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	5	861	1015	Earlier this month, a former Methodist Church president was detained after delivering a sermon calling for peaceful protests to restore democracy to Fiji. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	6	1025	1239	Reverend Manasa Lasaro has been at the forefront of opposition in the Methodist Church to the 2006 coup in which military chief and self-appointed prime minister Voreqe Bainimarama overthrew the elected government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	7	1249	1314	Bainimarama has since ruled out democratic elections before 2014.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	2	393	617	"China's people have wasted 60 years," Bao, now one of the country's top political dissidents, told AFP recently -- before authorities moved him out of Beijing to wait out Thursday's 20th anniversary of the deadly crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	3	627	770	His harsh assessment of the history of the People's Republic of China, founded in October 1949, is one few ordinary Chinese would dare to make.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	5	897	1099	He has spent the past 20 years either in jail, under house arrest or facing other restrictions in his small west Beijing flat, just one block from a major road where protesters battled tanks and troops. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	6	1109	1317	He sees no sign of political openness on the horizon and says Beijing's failure to come clean on the events of June 3-4, 1989 and give justice to victims has been a key factor stunting democratic development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	7	1327	1367	"It has had a seriously negative impact. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	8	1368	1504	It has made China a country with no voice.... a country in which no one can demand fairness," he said in the interview at his apartment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	9	1514	1741	"I am a sample on display," Bao says with a smirk, charging the government only allows foreign journalists to interview him to give the impression of openness, while preventing anything he says from being disseminated in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	10	1751	1937	Bao was dragged down along with Zhao, who was ousted from his position as general secretary of the Communist Party for sympathising with the student protesters who had rallied for weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	11	1947	2046	Zhao had opposed the use of force against the demonstrators, but was overruled by party hardliners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	12	2047	2115	Hundreds, and possibly thousands, were killed in the army crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	13	2125	2223	Bao, who once directed a top Communist party political reform office, is still lean and energetic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	14	2233	2391	He now spends much of his time doing interviews with or fielding calls from foreign media on a phone whose ring tone is the Disney theme "It's a Small World." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	15	2401	2587	Bao said China's current leaders bear no blame for what happened in Tiananmen Square -- and could earn great praise both at home and abroad on this anniversary by being more forthcoming. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	16	2597	2723	"They are still the nation's leaders and I hope they can openly tell the Chinese people and the world what happened," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	17	2733	2879	But the party's unwillingness to admit any mistakes will prevent that and the Chinese people are too intimidated to demand such honesty, he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	18	2889	3114	Much of the blame lies with the rest of the world for refusing to push China to heal the wounds, said Bao, adding that other countries were increasingly hesitant to rile China due to its growing economic and diplomatic clout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	19	3124	3322	"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a reliable, stable, peaceful member," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	20	3332	3359	"This is not a good thing." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	21	3369	3538	As the Communist Party gears up to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, Bao said there was little to celebrate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	22	3548	3689	The party wasted a lifetime with collectivisation of the economy launched in 1953, only to come full circle with today's run-away capitalism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	23	3699	3742	"(We) have come back to the original point. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	24	3743	3813	The work of 1.3 billion people has been wasted for 56 years," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	25	3823	3880	"This is a crime greater than (the Tiananmen crackdown)." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	26	3890	4053	Bao expressed delight with the May release in English of Zhao's memoirs, put together from secret tape recordings the deposed leader made while under house arrest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	27	4054	4117	His son, Bao Pu, is publishing the Chinese version of the book. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	28	4127	4245	He said he hoped the book, likely to be banned in China, could somehow be distributed in the country and spark debate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	29	4255	4416	But he admitted the ghosts of Tiananmen would not likely be laid to rest any time soon due to the nature of a government for which he wishes he had never worked. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	30	4426	4482	"I regret that I only realised all of this 20 years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	31	4483	4545	Why couldn't I have realised it 40 years ago or 60 years ago?" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	32	4546	4558	he lamented.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0442	5	858	997	But I'm now paying three-and-a-half times as much as I'd be paying on a normal home loan," he told Melbourne's Sunday Herald Sun newspaper.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0442	12	1413	1586	Philippoussis, who inspired Australia to two Davis Cup final victories, over France in 1999 and Spain in 2003, reflected on his fallen status as a one-time tennis celebrity.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	1	165	340	The following are brief profiles of the 10 people -- students, politicians and others -- who played key roles in the drama that unfolded in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989:

AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	17	1574	1618	-- Deng Xiaoping, the patriarch (1904-1997). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	18	1619	1883	The most influential of the leaders, the chairman of the Central Military Commission and father of economic reform tilted the balance in favour of a hard line and ordered the army to fire on protesters after six weeks of rallies that left the government paralysed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	19	1893	1944	-- Zhao Ziyang, the disgraced reformer (1919-2005).

AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	29	2633	2759	Even if this famous astrophysicist did not participate directly in the Tiananmen movement, his ideas were a clear inspiration. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	30	2760	2907	He had been thrown out of the Communist Party in 1987, and shortly after the crackdown in 1989, the authorities issued an arrest order against him.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	39	3720	3736	THE UNKNOWN HERO 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	40	3746	3932	-- On June 5, the day after the crackdown, a young man placed himself in front of a column of tanks, preventing it from passing down the Avenue of Heavenly Peace in the heart of Beijing.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	0	58	94	China faces dark memory of Tiananmen 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	1	169	351	Authorities in China are bracing for the 20th anniversary of the deadly June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, a pivotal moment that still haunts the nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	2	361	591	The way the government will likely mark the sensitive date on Thursday -- with deafening silence -- shows it is keenly aware of the emotional scars that remain after the army ended six weeks of peaceful rallies in central Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	3	601	832	China's Communist leaders have made any discussion of the brutal quelling of the student-led demonstrations -- in which hundreds, maybe thousands, were killed -- taboo, but dissidents say the public could yet hold them accountable. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	4	842	1053	"People remember this date because they want the Communist Party to take responsibility for the crimes it committed," said 53-year-old Qi Zhiyong, who lost a leg after being shot by troops near Tiananmen Square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	5	1063	1154	"It reminds them the party will resort to unbridled violence whenever it feels threatened." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	6	1164	1284	In a bid not to rankle the wary authorities, the main public commemoration planned for Thursday will probably be silent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	7	1294	1500	Activist groups have called on citizens simply to wear white -- the traditional colour of mourning -- to honour those killed in the mayhem that erupted when tanks and troops rolled in to crush the protests. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	8	1510	1734	The year 1989 was a disastrous one for communism across the globe and in China the ruling party found itself in a struggle with democracy activists who challenged its authoritarian rule over the world's most populous nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	9	1744	1975	The Tiananmen movement began in mid-April, when public grief over the death of former party leader and popular reformer Hu Yaobang gradually morphed into bold calls from students for political reform and steps to combat corruption. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	10	1985	2084	Young students started to occupy Tiananmen Square, the symbolic centre of political power in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	11	2085	2208	A sense of euphoria saturated the plaza as they took part in rallies no one would have thought possible just weeks earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	12	2218	2249	"There were banners everywhere. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	13	2250	2405	This was the first unauthorised political demonstration in the (history of the) People's Republic of China," recalled one of the student leaders, Wang Dan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	14	2415	2630	Calls for democracy and freedom filled the square, thousands went on hunger strike, and one charismatic activist, Wu'er Kaixi, brazenly challenged Premier Li Peng during a meeting broadcast live on state television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	15	2640	2868	Indeed, the whole world was watching, as news crews from around the globe gathered in Beijing to cover the historic visit by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, only to stumble upon an event that would be far more significant. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	16	2878	3045	In the corridors of power, the protests drove a wedge between hardline leaders led by Premier Li and moderates headed by Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	17	3055	3168	The hardliners won, with patriarch Deng Xiaoping, China's most powerful man, tilting the balance in their favour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	18	3169	3278	Zhao was removed from his post as party leader and spent 16 years under house arrest until his death in 2005. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	19	3288	3484	The student movement was declared a "counterrevolutionary rebellion", and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army descended on the capital, crushing the democratic dreams of an entire generation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	20	3494	3565	The number of people killed in the night of June 3-4 remains a mystery. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	21	3566	3624	China's official death toll is 241, including 36 students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	22	3625	3664	Dissidents say thousands may have died. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	23	3674	3871	The crackdown set off a wave of condemnation across the globe, and for several years China was treated as a near-pariah, as Western governments offered asylum to student leaders fleeing into exile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	24	3881	4089	The international community has long since welcomed China back into the fold, and Beijing's communist leaders have cemented their hold on power, transforming the country into the world's number three economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	25	4099	4269	But they have shown no willingness to change their position that the protests threatened Communist Party rule and had to be quelled in order to maintain economic reforms. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	26	4279	4475	"Facts have proven that the socialist road with Chinese characteristics that we pursue is in the fundamental interests of our people," foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told journalists in May. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	27	4485	4708	But, undeterred, victims of the crackdown have called for renewed international pressure on Beijing to reverse the official verdict on the quelling, saying failure to stand up to a rising China tacitly abets the repression. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	28	4718	4892	"So far, the international community... has adopted a policy of appeasement towards the Chinese government," said Ding Zilin, 72, whose teenage son was shot dead by the army. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	29	4902	5125	Bao Tong -- a former aide to Zhao who was jailed for seven years following the crackdown -- said the world has failed to push China to be more open about the events of Tiananmen because of Beijing's increasing global clout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	30	5135	5347	"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a reliable, stable, peaceful member," Bao told AFP recently. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	31	5357	5394	"This is not a good thing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	32	5404	5619	Bao has since been ordered to sit out the anniversary at a resort more than 1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from Beijing -- evidence that the authorities in the capital are not yet ready to reopen the Tiananmen wounds.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	1	208	402	President Barack Obama's administration has asked the Supreme Court to reject a request by Chinese Uighurs held at the Guantanamo Bay prison and cleared of all charges to be released on US soil. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	2	412	458	The petitioners "have already obtained relief. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	3	459	613	They are no longer being detained as enemy combatants," wrote US Solicitor General Elena Kagan in the administration's filing to the Supreme Court Friday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	4	623	862	Kagan wrote that the men, members of a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who fear persecution if returned to China, "are being housed in relatively unrestricted conditions given the status of Guantanamo Bay as a United States military base." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	5	872	1110	Four years ago US authorities cleared the 17 imprisoned Uighurs, but they are stuck at the Guantanamo prison due to fears that Beijing would torture them if they returned to their homeland in northwestern China's remote Xinjiang province. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	6	1120	1223	At the prison, the Uighurs are held at "Camp Iguana," a special area for detainees cleared for release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	7	1224	1369	They have more freedom and greater privileges than most other prisoners, including a recreational space and a library, according to the Pentagon. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	8	1379	1469	In October 2008 a federal judge ordered that the Uighurs be released in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	9	1470	1639	The most likely place for the detainees to be released would be in Washington's suburbs in northern Virginia, which is home to a significant Uighur expatriate community. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	10	1649	1716	A federal appeals court in February however overturned that ruling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	11	1717	1800	It is the Uighurs' appeal to that decision that the Supreme Court must now address. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	12	1810	1915	But for the Obama administration, which is repeating some of the reasoning that his predecessor George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	13	1916	2125	Bush used, "the decision whether to allow aliens abroad to enter the United States and if so, under what terms, rests exclusively in the political branches," according to the filing, which AFP obtained a copy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	14	2135	2474	For the government, the "petitioners' continued presence at Guantanamo Bay is not unlawful detention but rather the consequence of their lawful exclusion from the United States under the constitutional exercise of authority by the political branches, coupled with the unavailability of another country willing to accept them," Kagan wrote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	15	2484	2646	The nine justices sitting on the US high court have not yet said whether they would examine the politically explosive case, and could announce a decision by June. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	16	2656	2714	The legal case was filed by 14 of the 17 Uighur prisoners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	17	2724	2839	The Guantanamo camp was established by the Bush administration as an offshore prison for "war on terror" detainees. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	18	2840	2929	Some 800 youth and adults have passed through the prison camp and about 240 remain today. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	19	2939	3090	The US navy established a base in Guantanamo Bay at the end of the 1898 Spanish- American War, then signed a long-term lease with the Cuban government.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	24	3360	3551	Pressure is on Nintendo to deliver captivating titles for the Wii, which has been a sales sensation but could lose momentum in the absence of must-have new videogames to play on the consoles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	25	3561	3626	"Nintendo needs something; everyone is saying that," Hickey said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	1	182	339	French videogame titan Ubisoft is turning E3 into a playground for "Rabbids," madcap videogame rabbits breeding fans throughout Europe and the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	2	349	545	A team of Rabbids, accompanied by a street band from Romania, will "wreak havoc" outside an annual Electronic Entertainment Expo videogame industry extravaganza that begins Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	3	555	674	E3 attendees will be invited to hurl t-shirts and other tchotchkes given away at the event into a colossal faux toilet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	4	684	816	Rabbids will heap offerings on a trash mountain of items that will be donated to charity or recycled after E3 concludes on Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	5	826	952	The stunt is intended as levity as well as an unmasked promotion of an Ubisoft "Rabbids Go Home" videogame making an E3 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	6	962	1073	The Romanian band's music is featured in the fourth installment of an increasingly popular videogame franchise. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	7	1083	1235	"Go Home" play centers of getting the wacky animated characters to snatch all the "human stuff" they can find and pile it high enough to reach the moon. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	8	1245	1390	"They are like spoiled four-year-olds; distracted by everything," said Ubisoft game producer Adrian Lacey of the Rabbids team in southern France. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	9	1400	1518	"They are the child in everyone; the rebellious creature that does all the things we don't dare do but would like to." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	10	1528	1701	The Rabbid weapon of choice is a bathroom plunger, and antics in games includes cow hurling; pumping carrot juice into mouths, and demolishing portions of Paris by belching. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	11	1711	1832	Lacey notes that "Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party" was the first videogame to let players control action with their butts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	12	1842	1946	Players sitting on Wii console balance boards lean and shift to steer Rabbits in a downhill sleigh race. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	13	1956	2062	"What is true about the Rabbids is there are no regulations; go crazy and have fun with them," Lacey said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	14	2063	2086	"He has an edgy humor." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	15	2096	2196	The Rabbids franchise was launched in 2006, with each subsequent version outselling its predecessor. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	16	2206	2318	Ubisoft has sold more than six million Rabbids videogames, with one million of those sales in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	17	2328	2383	"We've seen the appeal just grow and grow," Lacey said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	18	2384	2478	"We are not at the point where we are a 'Super Mario' yet, but it would be nice to get there." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	19	2488	2681	Lacey laughingly equates the look of a Rabbid to "a sack of potatoes on two stumpy legs" and credits their unintelligible language to a team member prone to annoying people with strange sounds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	20	2691	2760	"He never looks ridiculous because he is," Lacey said of each Rabbid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	21	2761	2795	"It is one of those funny things." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	22	2805	2955	The Rabbids appeal prompted French car maker Renault to feature the characters in advertising and Kraft to use them to promote Capri Sun brand drinks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	23	2965	3111	"We're always looking for inventive ways to keep the brand cool and relevant with our audience," said Capri Sun senior brand manager Vinay Sharma. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	24	3121	3193	Rabbid fever has resulted in toys and figurines based on the characters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	25	3203	3252	"They should take over the world," Lacey quipped. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	26	3253	3303	"If I keep losing hair, I may turn into a Rabbid."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	1	189	379	US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton risks walking into what one analyst calls a Latin American minefield over ties with Cuba when she visits El Salvador and neighboring Honduras this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	2	389	620	The issue will hover over Monday's inauguration of new Salvadoran president Mauricio Funes in San Salvador and could cause a rift at the Organization of American States (OAS) general assembly in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on Tuesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	3	630	834	US officials could not even rule out the possibility of Clinton's skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for bringing Cuba back within the 35-member organization's fold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	4	844	1065	The United States wants Cuba to free political prisoners and respect political freedoms for it to participate fully in the OAS, saying it is holding the body to the democratic principles enshrined in its own 2001 charter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	5	1075	1158	Other OAS members say that Cuba can be nudged toward democracy once inside the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	6	1168	1334	Many members point out that the reason for Cuba's suspension in 1962 -- its role in the Cold War-era Soviet bloc -- does not apply today as the bloc no longer exists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	7	1344	1579	Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to use the issue to either push for a lifting of the decades-old US embargo on Havana or for their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	8	1589	1812	Since a popular US President Barack Obama took office in January, he has raised hopes among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo, even if he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	9	1822	1990	"This is going to be a complicated challenge for her (Clinton) to deal with," said Michael Shifter, an analyst for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	10	2000	2051	"I sense the Obama people are a little bit nervous. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	11	2052	2166	I think they're aware that it's a minefield, Cuba," said Shifter who pointed to the risk of a rift within the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	12	2176	2398	And Clinton's stop in San Salvador "creates a certain dynamic," Shifter said, because the presence of a Cuban leader at the inauguration will mark the start of El Salvador's own moves toward full diplomatic ties with Cuba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	13	2408	2608	It will expose the US position even more because, under the previous US-backed right-wing government, El Salvador was the last Latin American countries not to have normal relations with Cuba, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	14	2618	2737	Shifter said he has heard that Cuban President Raul Castro is attending, but AFP was unable to confirm the information. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	15	2747	2956	Asked if Clinton would meet with the Cubans at the inauguration, a senior US official said on the condition of anonymity: "We're not at the stage right now where the secretary would meet with Cuban officials." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	16	2966	3160	Shifter said the OAS secretary general, Jose Miguel Insulza, as well as radical leftist Venezuela, Nicaragua and host country Honduras were driving the agenda to have Cuba readmitted to the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	17	3170	3395	Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, he said, the Obama team would have preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with leftist but pragmatic democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil and Chile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	18	3405	3634	Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	19	3644	3840	Chris Sabatini, an analyst with the Council of Americas, said the new administration is trying to show that the "tent of democracy is broad" even while a few leftist radicals remain in the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	20	3850	4065	"It is an attempt to not so much isolate them (radicals) but to create a positive pole in the hemisphere of democrats that can't be easily labeled as just pro-US, but range across the ideological spectrum," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	21	4075	4281	Sabatini also expected the consensus-driven OAS to come to some agreement on the Cuba issue, saying the current debate amounted to a "tempest in a teapot" and a distraction to important human rights issues. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	22	4291	4348	On rare occasions, the OAS can vote on an issue, however. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	23	4358	4485	A senior US State Department official told reporters late Friday "it's hard to say" when asked if a consensus would be reached. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	24	4495	4576	Nor could he exclude the possibility that Clinton might have to skip the meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	25	4577	4617	"I can't answer that question," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	26	4627	4852	Spokespeople at the OAS headquarters told AFP on Saturday that no resolution had been reached and that the senior diplomats were leaving Washington this weekend to continue their negotiations on the Cuba document in Honduras. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	27	4862	4913	Clinton is due to depart for El Salvador on Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	1	182	387	The US auto industry faces a day of reckoning Monday, with the looming bankruptcy of auto giant General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of automaker Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	2	397	662	The once mighty US auto industry is reeling from the downturned market and global economic crisis, which has prompted massive intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new body blow to a US economy already in recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	3	672	799	The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	4	809	962	With the hours counting down for GM, the company bondholders' Saturday deadline expired without indication on whether they support the group's new offer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	5	972	1093	If they accept the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	6	1094	1216	They would also control 25 percent of the "new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	7	1226	1393	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	8	1403	1663	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain ahead of a Monday deadline imposed by the Obama administration on the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	9	1664	1703	It could take place as early as Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	10	1713	1835	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	11	1845	2007	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	12	2017	2172	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	13	2182	2369	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	14	2379	2455	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	15	2456	2503	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	16	2513	2713	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	17	2723	2891	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	18	2901	3093	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck in the early hours Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	19	3103	3251	The deal for GM's European operations, which was brokered by Berlin, amounted to a major development in the global rearranging of the auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	20	3261	3346	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	21	3356	3603	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	22	3613	3727	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	23	3737	3873	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, however, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	24	3883	3967	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	25	3968	4115	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	26	4125	4337	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	27	4347	4431	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	28	4432	4511	Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by June 15.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	1	172	341	US President Barack Obama swept First Lady Michelle Obama off to a Broadway show on Saturday night -- to honor a promise made in the heat of his gruelling 2008 campaign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	2	351	575	The Obamas flew to New York, not on the iconic presidential jet, but aboard a small military plane -- still dubbed Air Force One with the president aboard -- for a meal in Manhattan's West Village and a night at the theater. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	3	585	798	Republicans however immediately seized on the trip, accusing Obama of enjoying himself at taxpayers expense, as ordinary Americans battle the economic crisis and another iconic US firm, GM, struggles for survival. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	4	808	1013	Obama, in a statement issued through a spokesman, said: "I am taking my wife to New York City because I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	5	1023	1120	The epitome of glamour, the Obamas earlier left the White House aboard his Marine One helicopter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	6	1130	1303	At Andrews Air Force base outside Washington, they boarded the plane, the president in a smart dark suit with no tie, and the First Lady in a black cocktail dress and heels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	7	1313	1535	After landing in New York, they helicoptered into Manhattan and motorcaded to the Blue Hill restaurant, before heading to the Belasco Theater and the Broadway revival of the August Wilson play "Joe Turner's Come And Gone." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	8	1545	1639	Obama's Republican foes however tried to make political hay out of the president's date night. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	9	1649	1926	"As President Obama prepares to wing into Manhattan’s theater district on Air Force One to take in a Broadway show, GM is preparing to file bankruptcy and families across America continue to struggle to pay their bills," the Republican National Committee said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	10	1936	2014	The White House could not immediately put a price tag on the president's trip.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	6	1305	1456	However, in a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	7	1466	1619	Judge Piers Morgan said it was the "greatest performance I've seen on the history of Britain's Got Talent -- you should win the competition, I loved it." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	8	1629	1814	Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to perform for Queen Elizabeth II. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	9	1824	1981	More than a million viewers cast their vote following the live performances, and in the end, Boyle lost out to a group of ten young dancers, named Diversity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	10	1982	2027	Saxophonist Julian Smith came in third place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	11	2037	2145	After singing earlier in the evening, Boyle, wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress, thanked all her fans. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	12	2155	2227	"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	13	2237	2327	Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied emphatically: "Well worth it!... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	14	2328	2379	I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	15	2389	2616	Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on YouTube had questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	16	2626	2828	The British media had also reported some erratic behaviour over the past week, including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she was staying prompting police to intervene. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	17	2838	2951	Morgan said that she even considered quitting, describing her in his blog as a "frightened rabbit in headlights". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	18	2961	3083	But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have never heard such powerful confident vocals." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	19	3093	3319	Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could make millions of pounds in the next year if she capitalised on her global success, with the News of the World saying one of the show's judges, music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	20	3329	3504	"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell told the newspaper, which suggested an album, a film of her life and a memoir were in the pipeline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	21	3514	3635	Asked about her plans on television after the show, Boyle said: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just play it by ear." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	22	3645	3707	She added: "What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	23	3708	3734	Thank you for everything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	24	3744	3967	Hoards of fans had gathered in her hometown of Blackburn near Edinburgh to watch the final and support Boyle, and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond also congratulated the singer, saying she could "hold her head up high".

AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	1	171	374	Cricket's newest format returns to its birthplace when England hosts the World Twenty20 from Friday with the event kicking off a bumper summer which includes one of the sport's oldest combats, the Ashes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	2	384	567	But, as with all the other forms of one-day cricket first played in England at county level, the 'mother country' has found herself having to play catch-up with the rest of the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	3	577	761	Originally conceived as a fun way of bringing new audiences, particularly those who couldn't watch cricket during the working day, into the game, Twenty20 has taken the sport by storm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	4	771	939	Tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) are now far more lucrative per match for a player than five-day Test cricket, the traditional pinnacle of the sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	5	949	1144	India, whose administrators were originally hostile to Twenty20 because they feared its commercial impact upon the 50-over game, won the inaugural global tournament in South Africa two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	6	1154	1303	Nine members of that winning squad, which defeated arch-rivals Pakistan by five runs in a thrilling final in Johannesburg, will be coming to England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	7	1313	1514	But, in what above all other types of cricket is a game heavily weighted in favour of batsmen, India will be without master run-maker Sachin Tendulkar, who has now opted out of Twenty20 internationals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	8	1524	1728	Generally short boundaries and fielding restrictions put a premium on big- hitting batsmen and in Yuvraj Singh they have someone who struck England's Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over in South Africa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	9	1738	1908	Tendulkar, who himself played in this year's IPL, warned it was important that openers Yuvraj and Gautam Gambhir were refreshed after failing to find top form in the IPL. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	10	1918	2003	"I think the key would be how soon they can shed the fatigue factor," Tendulkar said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	11	2013	2162	Wicket-taking bowlers are an invaluable commodity in a game where economy rates can go out the window and India look to have a promising pace attack. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	12	2172	2316	Left-armer Rudra Pratap Singh, who took 12 wickets in South Africa in 2007, will be supported this time around by Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	13	2326	2539	Pakistan, starved of international cricket at home after a terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March made the country a 'no-go zone', will fancy their chances of going one better this time around. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	14	2549	2771	"I thought Australia would thrash them in the one-off T20 match in Dubai but it was the other way round and now, if Pakistan play to their potential, they can win the title," Pakistan great Wasim Akram told AFP this month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	15	2781	2948	Australia have dominated all forms of cricket during the last decade except Twenty20 and captain Ricky Ponting is determined to improve both his and the team's record. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	16	2958	3026	"The past couple of games I've played have been very poor," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	17	3027	3080	"In the two games in South Africa I made one in each. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	18	3081	3125	It's not great form going into a World Cup." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	19	3135	3226	Ponting gave Australia a scare when he sustained a hand injury during practice on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	20	3236	3326	But he is still expected to take part - which is more than England captain Andrew Strauss. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	21	3336	3566	The opening batsman has opted out of the tournament because he thinks he isn't a good enough Twenty20 player and the suspicion remains that England are more interested in the Ashes series against Australia that follows this event. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	22	3576	3817	England have never won a major international one-day tournament and they will be without all-rounder Andrew Flintoff (knee), now replaced by uncapped leg-spinner Adil Rashid, while doubts persist over star batsman Kevin Pietersen (Achilles). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	23	3827	3951	But the IPL and subsequent international form of Ravi Bopara has shown England that there is life beyond "Freddie" and "KP". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	24	3961	4209	Sri Lanka and New Zealand have repeatedly punched above their weight in international tournaments and could do so again during a tournament that will take place at three of English cricket's most historic venues - Lord's, the Oval and Trent Bridge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	25	4219	4320	And the West Indies could yet put a largely disappointing tour of England behind them in this format. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	26	4330	4570	Meanwhile South Africa, who won both of their two previous Twenty20s against Australia, are desperate to add a one-day title to set alongside their achievements in winning Test series in both England and Australia during the past 12 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	27	4580	4825	Bangladesh and Ireland, who have both enjoyed shock wins on the global stage in the past, will dream of further upsets although, with both Scotland and the Netherlands taking part, there is also the capacity for some hugely lopsided results too. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	28	4835	5084	For the first time the corresponding women's tournament will run in parallel with the main men's event, with both finals taking place on the same day at Lord's where, thanks in part to Twenty20, permanent floodlights are now a feature of the ground. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	29	5094	5133	The tournament gets underway on June 5.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	1	186	345	US sprinter Tyson Gay signalled his World Championship intentions with the third-fastest 200m time ever on Saturday at the Reebok Grand Prix Athletics meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	2	355	466	Gay, a treble world champion in 2007 whose 2008 Olympic season was wrecked by injury, won the 200m in 19.58sec. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	3	476	667	Only Jamaica's Usain Bolt, who won Olympic gold in Beijing in a world record 19.30sec, and Michael Johnson (19.32 at the 1996 Atlanta Games), have clocked faster times in the half-lap sprint. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	4	677	812	Gay, whose previous best for the 200m was 19.62 - in 2007 - said he thought 2008 sprint revelation Bolt would be "excited" by his time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	5	822	875	"I would think he would be pretty excited," Gay said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	6	876	910	"This is good news for our sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	7	911	936	It's good for both of us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	8	946	1098	"I don't know when or if we'll actually meet for a race," Gay said of the possibility of facing Bolt before the World Championships in Berlin in August. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	9	1099	1168	"But whenever it happens it figures to pretty good and pretty fast." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	10	1178	1352	Gay, who was competing in his first serious race of 2009 and had put in little speed-specific work in his training, said he had room for improvement in his technique as well. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	11	1362	1439	"I got out fast, but was probably leaning too much around the turn," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	12	1440	1542	"That might have slowed me down some, but considering this was my first big race, it was a pleasure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	13	1552	1895	"I just wanted to stay focused the whole way, keep  my knees up, then when I got to the straightaway, just run for my life ...  2008 that was all very unfortunate," added Gay, who was injured at the US Olympic trials last year, failed to reach the 100m final in Beijing and crashed out of the 4x100m Olympic relay heats with his US teammates. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	14	1905	1991	"But now 2009 is already looking pretty good, and the season is just getting started." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	15	2001	2126	American stars Wallace Spearmon (19.98), Xavier Carter (20.27) and Jeremy Wariner (20.30) finished 2-3-4 in Gay's slipstream. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	16	2136	2320	Bolt, who drew worldwide attention at this meeting last year with his 100m world record-setting victory in 9.72sec - a record he lowered to 9.69 in Beijing - didn't run here this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	17	2330	2459	"I don't really know what his asking price is these days, but we probably couldn't afford him," said meet promoter Mark Westmore. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	18	2469	2709	But Gay's time was one of eight world-leading performances produced on Saturday as he, fellow Americans Allyson Felix and Lauryn Williams and Kenyans Micah Kogo and Linet Masai gave the Icahn Stadium sellout crowd of 11,127 plenty of value. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	19	2719	2922	Proving once again that an Olympic gold medal is never a permanent invitation to the top step of the podium, 2008 Beijing champions Tirunesh Dibaba, Angelo Taylor and Veronica Campbell-Brown fell short. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	20	2932	3056	Ethiopia's Dibaba had won Olympic gold at 5,000 and 10,000 meters and set a world 5,000 record 14:11.15 in a brilliant 2008.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	25	3630	3825	Jamaica's Campbell-Brown, the Olympic 200m champion, ran the 100 instead and wound up third in 10.91 behind Americans Carmelita Jeter (10.85) and Muna Lee (10.88) but their times were wind-aided. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	26	3835	4119	Olympic 400m champion LaShawn Merritt fought through some tough in-his-face wind on the backstretch and then fought off Trinidad's Rennie Quow (44.89) and the Bahamas' Chris Brown (45.04) to take the men's one-lap race in 44.75, precisely one second slower than his 2008 Beijing time.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	1	198	382	Lasith Malinga is such an integral part of Sri Lanka's fast bowling arsenal that it needed the nation's president to intervene and ensure he was fit for the World Twenty20s in England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	2	392	586	The bowler with the rare sling-arm action, whose toe-crushing yorkers have tested the world's finest batsmen, sat out the entire 2008 and early 2009 season with a career-threatening knee injury. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	3	596	725	Malinga, 25, was unable to run or train, and the swollen bone in his right knee was so painful that he could barely climb stairs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	4	735	903	Worried the prodigious talent could be lost to the game, Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa recommended that Malinga should meet a spiritual healer Eliyantha White. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	5	913	986	"He (White) works with supernatural powers and herbs," explained Malinga. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	6	987	1046	"I don't know what he does or how he does it, but it works. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	7	1047	1092	I am very grateful to him and the president." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	8	1102	1158	The treatment lasted five days and the pain disappeared. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	9	1159	1197	Malinga was fit to start his training. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	10	1198	1285	White later reportedly cured veteran Sanath Jayasuriya of a long-standing back problem. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	11	1295	1471	Malinga marked his return to active cricket with a strong showing in the Indian Premier League in South Africa where he grabbed 18 wickets in 13 matches for the Mumbai Indians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	12	1481	1580	"He is fast and furious and never easy to get away," said an appreciative Mumbai coach Pravin Amre. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	13	1581	1623	"Sri Lanka will be very happy he is back." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	14	1633	1812	Sri Lanka's new captain Kumar Sangakkara, who once hailed Malinga as the team's 'X' factor' for turning a game on its head, was delighted his premier fast bowler was raring to go. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	15	1822	1899	"He looks fit and hungry and bowled really well in the IPL," said Sangakkara. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	16	1900	1937	"It's good to have him around again." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	17	1947	2092	Sri Lanka's former coach Tom Moody, who now looks after both Western Australia and IPL team Kings XI Punjab, said Malinga was an "unique" bowler.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	19	2135	2213	His very unique action, unique that he bowls at 90 miles an hour," said Moody. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	20	2214	2232	"He is different." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	21	2242	2300	Malinga's approach to bowling is simple and uncomplicated. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	22	2301	2371	Hurl the ball as fast as possible, preferably near the batsmen's toes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	23	2372	2446	It could rattle stumps or even break bones, but will never be easy to hit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	24	2456	2579	Asked recently to name the toughest batsman he had bowled to, Malinga said: "Lots of batsmen can be tough when they get in. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	25	2580	2616	But I try to focus on what I can do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	26	2617	2658	It just takes one ball to take a wicket." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0461	27	2668	2859	He famously took four wickets off four deliveries in a World Cup match in the Caribbean in 2007 where he guided Sri Lanka to the final with 18 wickets from eight games at an average of 15.77.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	1	172	356	Pace spearhead Umar Gul insists he will not curb his aggressive style of bowling during the World Twenty20, saying his wicket-taking ability is key if Pakistan are to clinch the title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	2	366	511	The 25-year-old, who is the leading wicket-taker in the newest form of the game with 24 victims in 14 matches, is in the best form of his career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	3	521	746	The lanky Peshawar-born paceman boasts a career-best 4-8 - the second best performance in T20 internationals behind New Zealand’s Mark Gillespie’s 4-7 against Kenya in 2007 - which helped Pakistan beat Australia in Dubai. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	4	756	985	"I want to do better than the last time," said Gul, who finished as the leading wicket-taker with 13 in seven matches to anchor Pakistan’s runners-up finish to India in the inaugural World Twenty20 held in South Africa in 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	5	995	1069	Gul said he sees the batsman-oriented Twenty20 cricket as a big challenge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	6	1079	1233	"Bowling in Twenty20 is a great challenge, but I am always up for it and I believe in attacking the batsmen from the first delivery to the last," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	7	1243	1377	Gul will be spearheading an attack which includes fast maturing Sohail Tanvir, Rao Iftikhar, Yasir Arafat and newcomer Mohammad Aamir. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	8	1387	1539	The line-up looks inexperienced after Shoaib Akhtar was withdrawn due to injury and with Mohammad Asif still absent because of a one-year ban on doping. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	9	1549	1614	But Gul is confident Pakistan can still bowl their opponents out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	10	1624	1824	"We have a balanced attack and if we bowl to a tight line and length, then we can get teams out or restrict them to gettable totals," said Gul, who prefers to come as first-change in Twenty20 matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	11	1834	1963	"Coming on first change helps you get more swing and it’s the ideal time to not only stop the flow of runs but to take wickets.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	1	182	359	England have never won a major international one-day tournament and, even allowing for home advantage, it will be a major surprise if they come out on top in the World Twenty20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	2	369	578	English one-day cricket has generally been based on the idea of the steady accumulation of runs, followed by a dash at the finish, and steady, containing bowling by medium-pacers who 'do a job' for their side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	3	588	840	What recent tournaments have shown is the need for wicket-taking bowlers in an era where economy rates are of limited value, given how aggressive modern batsmen are, and batsmen capable of scoring quickly, particularly in the early overs of an innings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	4	850	1072	The loss through a knee injury of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, a dynamic seamer with an ability to get reverse swing and, on his day, a hard-hitting batsman, would appear to have robbed the hosts of a genuine match-winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	5	1082	1269	Meanwhile, star batsman Kevin Pietersen's Achilles injury, which ruled the South Africa-born shotmaker out of the recent homne one-day series with the West Indies, also remains a concern. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	6	1279	1405	However, albeit in a 50-over format and against opponents who didn't seem too keen to be on tour, England won that series 2-0. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	7	1415	1576	And emerging England quick Stuart Broad, himself a handy lower order batsman, believes that Flintoff's absence need not spell the end of England's victory hopes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	8	1586	1691	"We've certainly won well without Fred in the past, but it's important we play good cricket," Broad said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	9	1701	1852	"He's obviously a very important player for us with bat and ball but players step up and take responsibility when he's not here, that's very important. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	10	1862	2001	"We need to gain confidence of winning without Fred so when he comes back into the side there will be a lot of belief and confidence there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	11	2011	2179	"Fred is the sort of bowler who gets thrown the ball in an important situation but when he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes responsibility." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	12	2189	2390	But apart from three wins over New Zealand last year, England have not beaten a major nation in Twenty20 cricket since levelling their two match series against the West Indies at The Oval in June 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	13	2400	2568	England's only win at the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa a few months later was against Zimbabwe, with the side losing to South Africa, New Zealand and India.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	15	2764	3024	And England coach Andy Flower believes Ravi Bopara can provide the solution to the side's longtstanding problems at the top of the order in one-day cricket which have been an issue since the international retirement of Somerset left- hander Marcus Trescothick. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	16	3034	3172	"You must be able to adapt, have strong hitters and top-class batsmen up front," Flower said in an interview with the Big Hitter magazine. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	17	3182	3336	"Ravi Bopara has shown what a class player can do at the top of the order, which you need against the new ball - not just lower order sloggers thrown in." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	18	3346	3541	England captain Andrew Strauss is sitting out this tournament on the grounds that he does not believe himself to be a good enough Twenty20 player, with the leadership passing to Paul Collingwood. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	19	3551	3628	"I don't think it (Strauss's authority) will be diluted at all," Flower said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	3	540	698	Roddy Smith, chief executive of Cricket Scotland, was frank in his asssement of the team's performance, telling the Scotsman newspaper: "There are no excuses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	4	699	764	Quite simply, the team's performances have not been good enough." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	5	774	869	Scotland, like many nations outside the Test elite, have a constant struggle to retain players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	6	879	1084	While the ICC makes laudable efforts to give them more games, team members must decide whether they can afford to take time off from their day jobs, with only three Scotland players on full-time contracts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	7	1094	1264	But there were encouraging signs during a May 28 Twenty20 warm-up match against Bangladesh where Scotland, although losing by six wickets, did bat through their 20 overs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	8	1274	1440	Much will depend for Scotland on the form of captain Gavin Hamilton, who played for England on their 1999 tour of South Africa, and Zimbabwe-born batsman Ryan Watson.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	1	171	348	Ireland will be looking to build on their reputation for causing cricket shocks in the World Twenty20 but they face some potentially gruelling encounters against the 'big boys'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	2	358	626	During the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, they famously beat Pakistan but the scale of the task facing them in this tournament was demonstrated when, during a warm-up match against New Zealand in Derby this week, they lost by seven wickets with three overs to spare. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	3	636	829	Given that Bangladesh, one of Ireland's group opponents (the others are India), took New Zealand to the last ball before losing in a warm-up match, the prospects do not look good for the Irish.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	5	920	1038	At the same, albeit 50 overs per side, World Cup where Ireland beat Pakistan, Bangladesh also famously defeated India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	6	1048	1304	Ireland coach Phil Simmons, the former West Indies batsman, has retained the bulk of the squad that won the recent World Cup qualifiers tournament in South Africa, with Jeremy Bray coming in for Andrew Poynter and Paul Strling taking over from Eoin Morgan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	7	1314	1642	Middlesex batsman Morgan has 'defected' to England, highlighting a perennial problem for Irish cricket in that their very best players, as was the case before Morgan with fellow batsman Ed Joyce, are always likely to 'cross the water' in search of greater professional opportunities and the chance to play five-day Test cricket. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	8	1652	1766	Ireland though will be bolstered by the return of experienced bowlers Trent Johnston, Alex Cusack and Boyd Rankin.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	0	58	110	Cricket: Gloveman McCullum holds key for New Zealand 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	1	188	380	The weight of New Zealand's Twenty20 World Cup expectations rests heavily on the shoulders of Brendon McCullum and his burning desire to be recognised as the world's best wicketkeeper-batsman. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	2	390	564	The diminutive gloveman is the key element in New Zealand's game plan with his audacious batting at the top of the order and his lightning-fast reactions behind the woodwork. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	3	574	724	That the 27-year-old's name is often mentioned as a contender to inherit the mantle of Australian great Adam Gilchrist speaks volumes for his ability. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	4	734	908	In the Indian Premier League, the Kolkata Knight Riders valued McCullum at 700,000 US dollars, the biggest offer for a New Zealand player, when they snapped him up last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	5	918	1115	They were immediately rewarded when he launched the inaugural IPL series by smashing a record 158 off 73 balls and he ended the season with an average 62.66 with the bat at a strike rate of 204.35. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	6	1125	1325	New Zealand's 2008 Player of the Year has also won high praise from Australia where a cameo McCullum performance helped New South Wales qualify for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in October. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	7	1335	1500	"There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances of a win, that is an undeniable fact," said Cricket NSW chief executive David Gilbert. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	8	1510	1703	In the just-completed second IPL series leading up to the World Twenty20, McCullum's batting was below par by his usual standards, finishing with an average of 23.75 at a strike rate of 119.24. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	9	1713	1857	But ominiously, McCullum was working his way into form as the World Twenty20 approached with two knocks in the 80s in his last four IPL innings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	10	1867	2080	In a side which struggles for consistancy, much is made of whether McCullum's best role with the bat is as a blockbusting opener or an aggressive middle-order hitter who can get New Zealand across the finish line. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	11	2090	2190	Coach Andy Moles is adamant he will lead with McCullum in partnership with the emerging Jesse Ryder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	12	2200	2367	"Opening is Brendon's place," he said with memories still fresh of the way McCullum engineered a clean sweep over India in their Twenty20 two-match series in February. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	13	2377	2531	McCullum carried his bat through both innings and in a dramatic finish to the second game he calmly stroked a single off the final ball to secure the win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	14	2541	2729	New Zealand will rely on that same McCullum calmness to get them through the World Twenty20, while the gloveman will be looking to enhance his own reputation as well as aiding his country.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	9	1515	1618	His new-won fame earned an IPL contract with Delhi Daredevils and a deal to use a unique two-sided bat.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	1	193	416	He’s an unlikely cricket star - a short, stocky all-rounder with a mediocre first-class record - but Roelof van der Merwe has become a Twenty20 player to be reckoned with since he made his debut for South Africa in March. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	2	426	620	Van der Merwe’s nickname with his Titans franchise is 'Bulldog' and he lives up to it with his aggressive attitude as a left-arm slow bowler, hard-hitting right-handed batsman or in the field. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	3	630	852	Selected for the South African under-19 team in 2004, his cricket career seemed to hit a dead end and he admits he spent more time partying than working on his game in his first year or so after leaving school in Pretoria. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	4	862	1090	He started attracting serious attention in the 2007/08 season with his economical bowling and effective pinch-hitting for the Titans in limited overs cricket, helping the franchise win both the 45-overs and 20-overs competition. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	5	1100	1229	On Twenty20 international debut he top-scored with 48 against Australia with a frenzied mixture of wild hits and judicious bunts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	6	1239	1361	He swung his bat with such ferocity that one attempted pull shot flew off a top edge over point for one of his four sixes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	7	1371	1567	Drafted into the South African one-day international side, he topped his side’s bowling averages and was the most economical bowler, twice taking three wickets in an innings in four appearances. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	8	1577	1715	Snapped up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, he became a regular member of the team that reached the final of the Indian Premier League.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	10	1796	1936	He bowls with tight control and his franchise coach Richard Pybus said: "He has an instinct for anticipating what a batsman is going to do."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	0	58	110	Cricket: Gloveman McCullum holds key for New Zealand 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	1	188	380	The weight of New Zealand's Twenty20 World Cup expectations rests heavily on the shoulders of Brendon McCullum and his burning desire to be recognised as the world's best wicketkeeper-batsman. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	2	390	564	The diminutive gloveman is the key element in New Zealand's game plan with his audacious batting at the top of the order and his lightning-fast reactions behind the woodwork. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	3	574	724	That the 27-year-old's name is often mentioned as a contender to inherit the mantle of Australian great Adam Gilchrist speaks volumes for his ability. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	4	734	908	In the Indian Premier League, the Kolkata Knight Riders valued McCullum at 700,000 US dollars, the biggest offer for a New Zealand player, when they snapped him up last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	5	918	1115	They were immediately rewarded when he launched the inaugural IPL series by smashing a record 158 off 73 balls and he ended the season with an average 62.66 with the bat at a strike rate of 204.35. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	6	1125	1325	New Zealand's 2008 Player of the Year has also won high praise from Australia where a cameo McCullum performance helped New South Wales qualify for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in October. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	7	1335	1500	"There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances of a win, that is an undeniable fact," said Cricket NSW chief executive David Gilbert. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	8	1510	1703	In the just-completed second IPL series leading up to the World Twenty20, McCullum's batting was below par by his usual standards, finishing with an average of 23.75 at a strike rate of 119.24. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	9	1713	1857	But ominiously, McCullum was working his way into form as the World Twenty20 approached with two knocks in the 80s in his last four IPL innings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	10	1867	2080	In a side which struggles for consistancy, much is made of whether McCullum's best role with the bat is as a blockbusting opener or an aggressive middle-order hitter who can get New Zealand across the finish line. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	11	2090	2190	Coach Andy Moles is adamant he will lead with McCullum in partnership with the emerging Jesse Ryder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	12	2200	2367	"Opening is Brendon's place," he said with memories still fresh of the way McCullum engineered a clean sweep over India in their Twenty20 two-match series in February. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	13	2377	2531	McCullum carried his bat through both innings and in a dramatic finish to the second game he calmly stroked a single off the final ball to secure the win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	14	2541	2729	New Zealand will rely on that same McCullum calmness to get them through the World Twenty20, while the gloveman will be looking to enhance his own reputation as well as aiding his country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0470	15	2739	2823	"I want to be the best batsman-keeper in the world," he told the New Zealand Herald.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	1	182	358	Ireland may be heading into the World Twenty20 without their best player but captain William Porterfield believes the side can still achieve great things during the tournament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	2	368	514	The Irish have seen star batsman Eoin Morgan called up by England just as was the case ahead of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean with Ed Joyce. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	3	524	672	But five years ago Ireland still managed to beat Pakistan and Bangladesh - one of their Group A opponents along with World Twenty20 champions India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	4	682	1023	Porterfield, an opening batsman who plays English county cricket for Gloucestershire, is hoping the form Ireland showed in dominating the 2011 World Cup qualifying tournament in South Africa and then by thrashing Worcestershire by 94 runs in an English Friends Provident Trophy 50-overs per side match, will carry on into the World Twenty20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	5	1033	1233	He has already shown he knows how to play a captain's innings - his 69 off 110 balls was central to Ireland's win over Worcestershire - and Porterfield reckons the side are getting better all the time 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	6	1243	1308	"The nucleus of the squad is still there from the 2007 World Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	7	1309	1367	And we've added the likes of Peter Connell and Regan West. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	8	1377	1442	"We now have more depth and there's more quality to choose from." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	9	1452	1531	Porterfield may be one day lost to Ireland, just as Morgan and Joyce have been. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0471	10	1541	1717	But in the meantime his experience of top-class cricket - his 85 was vital in the 2007 World Cup win over Bangladesh - could help the Irish again make a mark in a global event.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	2	357	564	Long one of the most consistent nations outside the Test elite, a run of poor results during the recent 2011 qualifying tournament in South Africa saw Scotland fail to make it to the showpiece event in Asia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	3	574	805	Ryan Watson was stripped of the captaincy and in his place came all-rounder Hamilton, whose one and only Test appearance a decade ago for England saw him fail to take a wicket and record a pair against South Africa in Johannesburg. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	4	815	985	Now 34, Hamilton's career in England was to suffer dramatically when a move from Yorkshire to Durham saw him get what golfers would term the 'yips' with his seam bowling.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	6	1192	1366	"We're realistic about our chances of winning games, but if there's ever a game to win, it's Twenty20 because the whole thing can turn around in two or three overs," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	3	478	821	But it says something about the self-belief of the son of former England opening batsman Chris that his confidence was not dented permanently when, during the corresponding tournament in South Africa two years ago, he became the first bowler to be hit for six sixes in an over during a Twenty20 international by India's Yuvraj Singh in Durban. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	4	831	864	"Anyone can get hit," said Broad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	5	865	942	"You can see that in the amount of Twenty20 cricket that is being played now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	6	952	1046	"They bring the boundaries in, they make it smaller and everyone wants to see fours and sixes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	7	1047	1135	So, as a bowler, you've got to accept sometimes you're going to be on the receiving end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	8	1145	1281	"The important thing is how you bounce back, how you improve as a bowler and how you learn new deliveries and practice different skills. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	9	1291	1411	"It's important, certainly at a young age, to learn from it, take it in your stride and turn everything into a positive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	10	1421	1534	"It was a chance to really improve me as a bowler and I couldn't be happier with the way the last year has gone." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	11	1544	1663	England were off the pace in South Africa, failing to beat a major nation during a run of just one win in five matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	12	1673	1821	But they will have home advantage on their side in a group that sees them take on Pakistan, losing finalists in 2007, and outsiders the Netherlands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	13	1831	1896	"I think hosting the event is a massive plus for us," said Broad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	14	1897	2037	"Twenty20 is really big in England on the domestic side so to be having the World Twenty20 is going to make the crowds even more excitable." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	15	2047	2251	And while Andrew Flintoff's latest injury, a knee problem, has ruled the star all-rounder out of the tournament, Broad said it was time England stopped despairing when confronted with life without 'Fred'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	16	2261	2364	"When he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes responsibility," Broad explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	17	2374	2454	"I thrive on that extra responsibility and I certainly like taking the new ball. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	18	2455	2544	We talk about the first 10 overs setting the tone and that's my job with Jimmy Anderson."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	1	183	378	England manager Martin Johnson admitted his side needed to show greater "urgency" against Argentina at Old Trafford this coming weekend after Saturday's 33-26 Twickenham defeat by the Barbarians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	2	388	592	An England team shorn of its British and Irish Lions and boasting some unfamiliar combinations were 33-5 down against the star-studded invitational team before a late rally made the scoreline respectable. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	3	602	882	However, 2003 World Cup winning captain Johnson was worried by the way in which the Barbarians were able to score five tries, including one from in-form Wallaby flanker Rocky Elsom, the hero of Irish province Leinster's European Cup win, and two from ex-England wing Iain Balshaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	4	892	940	"We were hesitant at times and lacked intensity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	5	941	1028	We must play with higher intensity and put teams under greater pressure," Johnson said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	6	1038	1100	"Defensively the way we gave away the tries was disappointing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	7	1101	1148	It was poor and our urgency wasn't good enough.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	1	185	303	Australia midfielder Tim Cahill insisted Everton had no reason to be ashamed after losing the FA Cup final to Chelsea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	2	313	465	Cahill choked back tears on the Wembley pitch after Saturday's 2-1 defeat but the Socceroos star had no intention of feeling sorry for himself for long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	3	475	700	Although Everton were briefly within touching distance of winning their first trophy for 14 years after Louis Saha gave them the lead just 25 seconds into the match, it was Chelsea who finished with the victory lap of honour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	4	710	900	The ecstacy of Saha's strike - the fastest goal in FA Cup final history - was replaced by agony as Didier Drogba equalised before the break and then Frank Lampard hit the second half winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	5	910	1044	Defeat was especially hard for Cahill to take as he had already lost one FA Cup final with Millwall against Manchester United in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	6	1054	1267	But the 29-year-old, the first Australian to play in two FA Cup finals, took heart from the way his team-mates had dug deep to reach the final despite injuries to key players like Mikel Arteta and Ayegbeni Yakubu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	7	1277	1360	"The best thing about this team is we stuck together, no matter what," Cahill said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	11	1602	1666	We're going to hold our heads up high and take this on the chin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	12	1676	1730	"We've had such a long season with such a small squad.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	14	1790	1845	I just hope everything stays the same for next season." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	15	1855	2039	As Cahill hid his face under his shirt at the full-time whistle, he was consoled by Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink, who grew to admire the midfielder during his spell as Australia coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	16	2049	2219	Cahill was a key figure as Australia reached the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup under Hiddink and he was keen to share a few words of encouragement with his former player. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	17	2229	2287	"I have a special relation with Tim Cahill," Hiddink said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	1	180	350	Frank Lampard described Guus Hiddink as managerial genius after the Dutchman guided Chelsea to victory in the FA Cup final before saying an emotional farewell to England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	2	360	559	Hiddink, who has been temporary manager at Chelsea for four months, is due to fly to Moscow this week to resume his role as coach of the Russian national team having made a big impact in west London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	3	569	778	Chelsea were in turmoil when he first arrived, having just sacked manager Luiz Felipe Scolari following poor performances in the Premier League and a highly- public falling out with star striker Didier Drogba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	4	788	993	But Drogba, left to train with the youth team by Scolari, completed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes as he scored one of the goals in Saturday's 2-1 victory over Everton in which Lampard hit the winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	5	1003	1253	The result ended two years without a trophy for Chelsea, who are hotly tipped to name AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti as their next manager despite the popularity of Hiddink who has always maintained his commitments with Russia made it impossible to stay. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	6	1263	1328	Lampard said: "Some people think that's bewildering but it's not. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	7	1329	1400	It was always going to be until the end of the season so we understand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	8	1401	1482	But he's been absolutely fantastic to work with, every player will tell you that.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	13	1796	1861	I don't want to sound too romantic about it all but that's true!" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	14	1871	2033	Hiddink has left such a big mark on the Chelsea squad that many feel he will be a tough act to follow, even for a manager of such immense experience as Ancelotti. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	15	2043	2141	Lampard added: "I think that's true but anyone who comes into a Chelsea job knows it's a huge job. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	16	2142	2244	Success is what everyone craves here and quite rightly so with the squad and the investment that here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	17	2254	2380	"So yes the new manager will have a hard act to follow but I'm sure he will have credentials that will take the club forward." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	18	2390	2664	Drogba has more reason than most to be nervous of what the future holds at Stamford Bridge, especially as he is currently waiting to see what punishment he will receive after being charged by UEFA for his behavior following the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	19	2674	2795	But he was given a rousing reception by Chelsea fans at the final whistle at and has yet to discuss his long-term future.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	22	2930	2986	But I'm delighted to finish the season the way we have." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	23	2996	3214	Drogba has been revitalised under Hiddink and was impressive again at Wembley as Chelsea came back from conceding an opening goal to Everton's Louis Saha after just 25 seconds, the fastest goal in FA Cup Final history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	24	3224	3411	It was Drogba who headed Chelsea level - his fifth goal in a major final for the club - before Lampard's wonderful left-foot strike arrowed into the net for the winner in the second half. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	25	3421	3504	Drogba said: "It was a difficult start but you have to say it was a very good goal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	26	3505	3602	But our strength is to believe in ourselves and our qualities and we played with more confidence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	27	3603	3622	That's why we won." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	28	3632	3724	Drogba also paid tribute to the effect Hiddink has had on Chelsea since he replaced Scolari. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	29	3734	3795	He added: "I think the discipline between us was always good.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	2	448	668	Hiddink joined Chelsea's stars in a wild dressing room celebration at Wembley on Saturday, which saw even Roman Abramovich lose his inhibitions and throw a few shapes alongside Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel and company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	3	678	807	A first trophy for two years does that kind of thing to a club who had grown used to such occasions during Jose Mourinho's reign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	4	817	1106	But, while Hiddink was delighted to savour every moment of a perfect farewell before resuming his role as Russia coach on a full-time basis, the Dutchman believes it is the Mourinho era that Abramovich must recreate if Chelsea are to enjoy more champagne-soaked celebrations in the future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	5	1116	1335	Since Mourinho was eased out after a bitter power struggle in September 2007, Chelsea have been through three managers and Abramovich is set to appoint a fourth, most likely AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti, in the next week.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	7	1510	1607	"We had a nice dance party with everyone participating, the players and the staff," Hiddink said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	1	192	321	David Moyes insists Everton must use the pain of their FA Cup final defeat against Chelsea as motivation for success next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	2	331	520	Moyes' side were unable to take silverware back to Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years despite the boost of Louis Saha's record-breaking first minute strike at Wembley on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	3	530	667	Saha gave Everton a shock lead just 25 seconds after kick-off, claiming the record for the fastest ever FA Cup final goal in the process.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	5	733	893	Guus Hiddink's team methodically worked their way back into the game and equalised through Didier Drogba before Frank Lampard drove home the second half winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	6	903	1061	Moyes cut a dignified figure after the match as he insisted Chelsea were deserved winners, but deep down the Blues boss was feeling the pain more than anyone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	7	1071	1218	He knew how significant a Cup Final victory would have been in his attempt to establish Everton as a major threat to the Premier League's big four. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	8	1228	1384	But the numbing sense of a missed opportunity couldn't totally dampen Moyes' desire to emphasise that Everton are still within touching distance of success.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	13	1760	1826	"I just felt that this year it was a real reward for the players." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	14	1836	1918	McCoist added: "I am absolutely looking forward to my break like you have no idea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	15	1919	2019	I've got the golf clubs looked out and hopefully I'll take a few quid off the manager in the summer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	16	2029	2223	"I think the players will be looking forward to getting away from us more but they really need a break, especially with last season when they didn't get as much of a break as we would've liked." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	17	2233	2339	McCoist also heaped praise on striker Novo, who scored 36 seconds after coming off the bench at half-time.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	20	2659	2677	"It was very good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	21	2678	2782	Looking at the context of the game and the quality of the goal it will take some beating," McCoist said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	22	2783	2872	"It's certainly one of the great goals to win any cup final in any country I would think. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	23	2882	2902	"I can still see it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	24	2903	3070	I was actually praying he would hit it as he got himself that wee half yard in front and I thought, just have a hit and see what happens, and I knew it would be close. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	25	3080	3117	"Nacho is just an incredible wee guy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	26	3118	3187	He's got a wonderful rapport with the fans and the rest of the squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	27	3197	3269	"He deserves his success because he works so hard every day in training. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	28	3279	3411	"Anywhere lights up when the wee fellow walks in, whether it's onto a football park or into a room, he‘s just that kind of person.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	32	3800	3866	You obviously just have to wait and see what happens," Smith said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	33	3876	3992	"Going upstairs today (to collect the Scottish Cup) is the kind of thing I wanted to do when I came back to Rangers.
