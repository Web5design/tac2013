President Barack Obama is hitting back at Republican criticism of his energy policies and his role in controlling gasoline prices.

(snip)
"I'm going to keep doing everything I can to help you save money on gas, both right now and in the future," Obama said. "I hope politicians from both sides of the aisle join me."

He accused Republicans of a "bumper sticker" approach to solving the nation's energy problems.

(snip)
"We can't just drill our way to lower gas prices Â— not when we consume 20 percent of the world's oil," Obama said in the address, recorded during a visit Friday to a Virginia jet engine component plant.

1. Never turn your back to Republican lies and distortion.

Jam the truth down their throat untill they choke then do it some more. Where are the other Democrats willing to do the same and not leave it to Obama?

2. Exactly. John Kerry ignored a repuke lie for a little too long...

And we all know how that turned out.

Unfortunately they make up new lies all the time, and it takes constant effort to refute them.

8. Yep. Let's blame only Kerry instead of

a lazy media and Dems that sat on the sideline and did nothing while their candidate was smeared.

Guess the K campaign sucked really bad cause some of them went to work for Obama. (speakes volumes) Seems the Senator defends Obama plenty, but guess that people are too blind to see that.

Thanks alot Cahill and Shrum for making a decent Dem be seen as the unofficial poster Dem for not fighting back. Thanks for nothing.

Thank goodness we don't blame Obama like we always continue to blame Kerry.

3. I heard

a liberal talk show where I listened to what they perceived as "the goppers continiously beat the bomb bomb Iran talk" over and over which has caused the oil speculators to jump on the band wagon of higher gas prices re: FEAR.

And also, drilling here in the US is at a all time high and there IS a overflow of oil which is being sold out of the country. GOP won't tell you that will they.

10. Also, drilling more NOW would not bring prices down NOW...

simply because it would take an unknown amount of time before that petrol would reach the gas pumps, and that by then, speculatoR$ would have cashed-in the difference already...

4. The BIGGER LIE is that all domestic oil is sold on the international markets. NO US oil is

earmarked only for sale in the USA, therefore, no matter how much we drill it will have little effect on domestic prices.

Further - it is cheaper to drive electric cars powered by windmills - about 1/10 the cost.

5. Here is exactly what I would do

1. Run the clip from 2000 when Bush was debating president Gore, blaming Clinton for the "high" gas prices
2. While it runs, display the gas prices when Bush took office (1.41) the highest they were while he was in office (4.12).
3. Have a pane that says, "That's right- they tripled"
4. At the end, have a big screen that says, "Desperate Republicans Lie"

FWIW, when Big Oil threatened Obama over his Keystone veto, he should have gone on the air and told everyone that any price hikes could now be clearly identified as economic terrorism by Big Oil. He pissed away an enormous opportunity that he can't get back

7. Amen to that! People have amnesia from Dubya's time in office...

Maybe it's selective memory. They are trying to block out all the bad memories I suppose.

Our local Fox station just had another worthless news story about high gas prices. Nary a mention about the last time prices were this high. You'd think this was some kind of amazing record or something.

6. Keystone is not a solution either..

He needs to tell those wall street speculatory fuck-alls to complie with the law, the one about excessive speculation on commoditites like oil and gas, that is in the Frank-Dodd bill that was passed.
