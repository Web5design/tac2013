The Obama administration is monitoring gasoline and diesel fuel prices in 360 U.S. cities to guard against fraud or price manipulation, according to a White House report released today.

President Barack Obama said at a press conference March 6 that he asked Attorney General Eric Holder to reconstitute a special task force to ensure the government is watching for potential speculation in the oil markets. The extent of the gasoline and diesel price monitoring is in todays report, which also says the administration has made progress weaning the U.S. from foreign oil imports.

Todays high gas prices are a painful reminder that theres much more work to do free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil and take control of our energy future, Obama said in a statement released with the report.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures markets, has also taken steps to close loopholes that allowed financial trades to evade scrutiny by trading in unregulated or overseas markets, according to the report.

6. Democrats piss me off.

I still vote for them though. That's because there are republicans among us, walking on their knuckles.

10. If we are to regard that as a valid position, then so is #1. Some of us vote the gestalt, looking

for the opportunity/circumstances to paralyze those Republican knuckle draggers.

The main emphasis is the March 6th announcement - is this LBN ?

9. Is Obama trying to soften us up for building more nasty, killer-nuclear reactors?

I recall that that is why I did not support him in the primaries to begin with. He was too cozy with nuclear energy.

11. Energy transition? I'm for it. Perhaps you could help by making a list of those

who are expendable when we throw the switch on nuclear power plants?

I want to get there too, but not on the backs of the poor. Aren't the real questions about what the deal will be; what gets traded for what? Don't you have to be at the table in order to define YOUR OWN terms?

16. I don't understand your post.

Here in Southern California, we have seemingly endless sun. Arizona is similar as are parts of Texas and New Mexico. Why can't we develop solar energy with greater speed?

Have you seen the video featuring Greg Palast and his information about the nuclear energy industry?

We have not begun to count the deaths from the Fukushima disaster yet.

Come out and see San Onofre -- within feet of the Pacific Ocean and in an earthquake zone.

17. They CAN'T just throw the switch on nuclear power. We aren't ready. It will cost many many lives.

It's going to be different for different parts of the country. I understand California is waaaaaaay ahead on lots of stuff. A speaker at OccupyKochTown/Fight Tar Sands told us how different it is there. Other parts of the country cannot make the transition as quickly and easily as CA. In order for alternative energies to get the BEST DEAL FOR THEMSELVES in the changes ahead, they must be at the table, a seat at the table involves recognizing that not everyone is going to be able to just throw the off switch on nuclear power just like that. It must be phased out in lots of places under very specific conditions with very specific foundational commitments to alternative energies, where practically none have existed. I understand the idea of creating political pressure by being hard ass anti-nuclear power, but I'm not sure how well that works if it creates power-hungry single issue activists that don't care about other issues and/or don't care about the harm to people, especially vulnerable people, by proceeding too precipitously.

18. According to Greg Palast, Obama is thinking of authorizing MORE nuclear reactors for

the production of energy. I'm concerned about phasing out (as you would put it) the reactors now operating in our country starting with the least safe. But if Greg Palast is correct, Obama is considering licensing more. That's what I don't want to see.

low 4.19
high 4.39

That's not even the neighbor islands, which are always way worse...

Damn tankers from Indonesia stop in Honolulu on the way to to California, why should gas be so much higher here????
