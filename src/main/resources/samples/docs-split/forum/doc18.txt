2. It makes me wonder why Premier Radio Networks would even want to carry

such an unprofitable show (hint hint)? Perhaps the best outlet for Rush would be NPR (sorry for my sadistic sense of humor today). <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/rofl.gif"/> <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/rofl.gif"/> <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/rofl.gif"/> <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/rofl.gif"/>

4. It makes me think that maybe advertisers were feeling like hostages

no one wanted to leave the pool because they were afraid of the blowback from Rush's "20MM" listeners. Now, they have are feeling safe to exit because they are one amongst many making the move. No one wants to be seen as the last business supporting hate radio. Great news. Rush will eventually take his Excemence in Broadcasting and move it to satellite radio where his dittoheads can pay for the privilege of polluting their minds.
