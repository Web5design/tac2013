ORLANDO, Fla. -- Former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson crashed into a Lynx bus in downtown Orlando about noon Saturday.

Grayson was traveling to an upscale fundraising event for his Congressional campaign.

Authorities with the Orlando Police Department said the crash happened at Orange Avenue and Livingston Street.

1. Was he in a tuxedo? What defines an "upscale" fundraising event?

I wonder why reporters pick the words they use or emphasize what they emphasize....would the accident not have happened if it was a "down home" fundraising event and the former rep was driving a pick up instead of a Mercedes? If RFK Jr. hadn't been a featured guest, and Larry the Cable Guy was instead?

The "stink" on this story is that the "elitist" in the Mercedes crashed into the bus. The "suggested donation" of a grand is hardly "upscale" in the Big Picture--hell, that wouldn't get you the opportunity to crap in a porta-potty on the outskirts of one of Dubya's Pioneer BBQs.

Someone needs to slap the bias right off this thing.

No serious injuries--that's a relief, certainly. The rest of the slant I can do without, to be frank...

4. Upscale= more than two teeth to rub together.

Sad but true.

33. Yes it does sound a bit bias... Also I'm wondering why Grayson will

be sited for this, vs at the time of the accident. I'm assuming the officer at the scene would of already sited the person responsible for this...

34. If he ran a red light and hit a bus, we know he didn't do it deliberately.

He's not suicidal. It was an unfortunate accident, he may have been in a hurry. He didn't intend for it to happen.

He probably will be cited, and that's the breaks. He'll have to pay the ticket, get a "Naughty Boy" note on his insurance, and his rates will go up a bit.

What irritated me about the article was all the snide allusions to "upscale" wealthy elites, like RFK, Jr. and suggesting that a grand was "Big Money" in the political scheme of things. It's not Big Money.

You couldn't get near a Bush BBQ for anything less than TWENTY FIVE TIMES that price of admission, and even at that, you had to pony up more still to get to chat with The Great One.

Hope he's okay, as well as anyone in the bus.

5. He FIGHTS for us, and that's all that matters to me

I don't care if he was driving a gold plated hummer, he FIGHTS for us, he speaks TRUTH to power!!!

I'm glad he's ok. one of the few decent people in Florida it seems.

10. Who gives a crap how much money he has when

he fights very hard for us. Jesus! Do you feel the same way about the Kennedy's? At what income do you think a person can be one of us? What's the cut off amount? A million dollars? $200 thousand? $50 thousand?

Or is someone one of us when they're fucking decent people no matter how much money they have?

the amount of money isn't the issue: it's his intent that's important.

there are a lot of poor folks whose intent is crap.

30. It was a bus

It could well be that the two injuries happened when passengers fell down in the crash and got a bad scrape or something, but in any car on bus crash, I'd rather be in the bus.

<img src="http://www.lewiscountysirens.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2011.1124.bus_.car_.rochester.trim_2.jpg"/>

If you've ever seen what happens to a car and a bus when a car hits a bus, you'll see that the car comes out much worse, and the bus usually looks pretty pristine. It has a lot more mass. It's quite common for the occupants of the car to suffer fatal injuries while no one on the bus is seriously hurt.

6. Sounds like he was late and thought he could run a red light

Never a good idea. <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/sad.gif"/>

"Investigators said Grayson was driving a Mercedes, when he ran a red light and hit the bus."

"A news release for GraysonÂ’s campaign event stated it was scheduled from noon until 1:30 p.m. at the penthouse of some local Democrats in The Vue, a high-rise condominium near Lake Eola.

The Orlando Police Department website stated the time of the call to the incident was 12:08 p.m. The Orlando Fire Department dispatched the call at 12:06 p.m."

21. I try very hard not to run red lights, espceially since I got ticketed for running a YELLOW

light. He said it was red, but it was yellow... The light turned yellow as the front tires of the car ahead of me entered the intersection. The light stays yellow for four seconds. (Damned extortionists.)

That's a fantastic way to kill or maim someone in busy trffic.

Noon? In a city? Not even.

19. The alleged minor injuries were reported by two bus passengers, while those in the much smaller car

appeared just fine, thanks.

I'm not so sure that in just reading about this Democratic former Congressman's accident, I didn't sustain a bit of neck pain, myself. I may need to wear a neck brace.

It is wonderful learning he was not injured, nor his passenger. Undoubtedly he's going to take extra care from now on.

Democrats have every possible reason to hope he will be re-elected. He so clearly is needed.

26. Wow

How reckless do you have to be to run a red light in earnest in broad daylight on a road busy enough to have a city bus while SOBER?

Seriously. I don't even accelerate on yellow (an unfortunately fairly standard practice that might have you just barely running a red) when I'm on a road with any amount of traffic.

27. Was he driving? Or one of his people or security?

was he driving?

this reminds me of Jon Corzine's accident

In Florida, if I ran a red light, and then get in an accident, I would be arrested

Doesn't matter that we "like" or "dislike" a candidate.

A damn little car accident ruined the presidential hopes of Ted Kennedy (who was one of US,
a damn good human being,(and being human means making mistakes),
no matter how much money he had).

Money is not evil. Evil People with money, using money for evil things are evil.
