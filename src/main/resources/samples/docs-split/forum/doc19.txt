All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison.

Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general.

In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons "may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch."

Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested "solely with the governor."

2. It is the Executives' prerogative....

.... old concept, but its good to be King, President, Governor! May not like it in this case, but it is not a tradition I would want curtailed.

5. It's a tradition that needs to be curtailed absolutely.

The number of actual miscarriages of justice corrected by gubernatorial/presidential pardons is miniscule.

The number of political nests feathered on the other hand is enormous.

6. This is particularly true at the national level.

In the age of Watergate and Iran/Contra, pre-emptive pardons of the President's cronies - and even pardons that a President can give to himself - are clear examples of serious abuse.

3. Waiting to see...

by what remarkably creative theory the Republicans place the blame for this on the Democrats.

4. Actually, it's the Democrats who have been playing politics on this one.

The executive has the power to pardon and commute sentences, as the high court in Mississippi noted. Given that the US has the world's highest incarceration rate and has hundreds of thousands of non-violent prisoners behind bars, it's a shame the power isn't exercised more frequently around the country--and at the White House. Obama finally commuted the sentence of his first drug offender around Christmas time; a just leader would commute them by the thousands.

In Mississippi, the Democratic attorney general attempted to make political hay and score cheap points by attacking the outgoing Repubican governor over it. "Tough on crime" politics is always tempting, even if it's often wrongheaded.

Also, of the 200-some offenders granted clemency 190 got pardons (meaning they had already done their time, in some cases decades ago) while only 10 or so got commutations (actually got out of prison early).

7. Obama's failure to act

Indeed, many more thousands of individuals should have their sentance commuted and or pardoned. It is a failure of Obama administration and most of the governors that this is not done on a regular basis. I guarentee you I could find a person every day that should be pardoned or paroled.
