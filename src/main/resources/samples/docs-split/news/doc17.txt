President Barack Obama expressed outrage on Sunday at the fatal shooting of a
controversial Kansas doctor who performed late-term abortions, in a statement
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of
Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. A suspect was arrested three
hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years Tiller had been picketed, bombed and shot in both of his arms by
anti-abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.
