<P>
Florentino Perez will be sworn in once again as president of Real Madrid on
Monday since no other candidate stood against him before the deadline for
applications passed, the club said.
</P>
<P>
"The new president of Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, will be sworn in on
Monday," the club said in a statement posted on its website after the deadline
of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired.
</P>
<P>
Several challengers who had been expected to oppose the 62-year-old construction
magnate pulled out or were not able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million
euros (81.1 million dollars) with the club required to be able to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team, from 2000 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera
Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
Real has been led on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda, who took the reins of
the club after Ramon Calderon stepped down in January following allegations that
he rigged voting at the club's last annual general assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
Had another candidate stood against Perez, elections for president -- normally
held every four years -- would have taken place on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Real's arch-rivals Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the
Spanish Cup this season under debutante coach Pep Guardiola.
