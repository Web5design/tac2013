Secretary of State Hillary Clinton began a visit to Central America Sunday, amid
new US steps toward ties with Cuba that Washington hopes will slow a sudden
regional push to end Havana's isolation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton landed in San Salvador from Washington where a senior State Department
official announced that Cuba had agreed to resume talks with the United States
on migration and direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
The chief US diplomat is in El Salvador for Monday's inauguration of president-
elect Mauricio Funes before traveling to neighboring Honduras for Tuesday's
general assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
The OAS is beset by a row over the pace of normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama's administration insists Cuba release political prisoners
and improve political freedoms before it is readmitted to the 35-member
organization. Some OAS states however want Cuba readmitted right away.
</P>
<P>
A senior US official, who is traveling with Clinton, told reporters that Havana
informed Washington on Saturday that it will take up the US offer to resume
long-stalled talks on migration issues and on direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Cubans have to determine a mutually convenient place and time," he
added on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of
additional dialogue," such as in counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, hurricane
and disaster preparedness response.
</P>
<P>
US officials said May 23 that the Obama admistration had proposed to resume the
discussions on migration issues, wihch had been conducted every two years until
they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
It was also Washington that proposed recently to resume direct mail service, the
official said, adding mail has for years, if not decades, been sent between the
United States and Cuba through a third country.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the new steps to engage Cuba would affect the OAS meeting in San
Pedro Sula, the senior official said "it is hoped ... that the region will
recognize that anything done within the ambit of the OAS ... should support and
foster this development, as opposed to hinder it."
</P>
<P>
US officials earlier declined to even rule out the possibility of Clinton's
skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for
bringing Cuba back within the OAS.
</P>
<P>
Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to
use the issue to either push for a lifting of the US embargo on Havana or for
their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since a popular Obama took office in January, analysts say, he has raised hopes
among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo, even if
he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the new steps, the Obama administration has called past US policy a
failure and moved to repair ties with Cuban President Raul Castro, who
officially took over the reins from older brother Fidel last year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Obama lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on Cuban-Americans
with relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, analyst Michael Shifter said, the
Obama team would have preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with
leftist but pragmatic democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to
power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist
guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil
war.
</P>
<P>
US Congressman Eliot Engel, who chairs a subcommittee on Western hemisphere
affairs who is traveling with Clinton, saw Clinton's visit to El Salvador as
halting a lurch in Latin America toward the extreme left.
</P>
<P>
"I think it means we want to engage with El Salvador because we don't them
drifting all the way left," Engel told reporters.
