Hi,

Our Google group has around 20 members. It is a good start. To begin,
how about everyone post a message introducing him/herself?

To facilitate the communication, please set the &quot;Name&quot; field of your
group membership information following what I and Zhao Ye have done.
The format Â is &quot;Name (Institute)&quot;.

Cheers,

Xiaoru

Hi, all,
this is Ye Zhao from Kent State University. I got my PhD from Stony
Brook University last year and now is an assistant professor at Kent,
Ohio. I am working on natural phenomena simulation and visualization. I
am now looking for good PhD students. If you know someone may be
interested, please give them a recommendation. Thanks a lot!
